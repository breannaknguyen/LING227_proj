		<content>I (23F) work as a junior paralegal in a corporate office, I sit with the personal secretary of the Director and the administrations and processing team.//Most of my team are in their 30s and the Directors secretary is in her late 40s I assume.//For a bit of background on me, I am 3 months pregnant so obviously not showing at all and I have always naturally been very thin.//So on Friday at work, me and my colleagues were talking about my pregnancy and baby names (I don’t know the gender yet obviously) and the secretary pointed out that I wasn’t showing yet (obviously I’m only 3 months, as far as I’m aware she does not have children).//She then said ‘how do you stay so thin’, she was laughing and said to my other colleagues ‘look at her there’s nothing on her’, by this point I was starting to feel offended and my colleagues laughed but they didn’t really say anything.//I told her I’m just naturally like that but I want to gain weight, she said ‘you don’t realise how lucky you are to have a body like that, carrying these (her boobs) isn’t easy. Can you imagine just walking around carrying nothing ( referring to me having small boobs ), I’d be so free’ she said this to my colleagues who aren’t big they’re more ‘average weight’ and one of them also doesn’t have big boobs at all so I don’t know why she directed it at me. I said ‘I’ve got a little something here’ because I didn’t want to show I was offended and was trying to joke with them. She said ‘who are you kidding you’re tiny’ they were all smiling and laughing a bit.//I said ‘how can I gain weight like you then’. It literally just came out and it was very awkward everyone just went silent I don’t even think it was that rude.//She said ‘what do you mean how can you gain weight like me’ and was laughing. I said ‘well I want to put more weight on so how do I do that ‘ I kind of tried to play it like I was asking her how to put on weight and for tips.//She got all serious and was like ‘you want to put weight on like me’ and then just went back to typing at her desk and I was just like really awkward.//She didn’t talk to me for the rest of yesterday and she was making jokes and laughing with my other colleagues but just ignored me and didn’t say goodbye to me yesterday either.//I’m at work now and she hasn’t said good morning. when I’ve asked her work related questions she answered but whilst looking at her computer or whilst she’s typing.//I feel so uncomfortable and I work for a really good Company and obviously she’s the directors assistant and has been there for a long time and I don’t know whether to apologise. I’m scared she’ll tell him but also I didn’t think it was fair what she was saying to me.//Am I the asshole for saying that? I think I should’ve been the better person and laughed it off but she is always saying stuff about what I wear and my body but I know overweight people can also be sensitive with their weight.</content>

		<content>TL;DR Co-worker gets annoyed with a running joke I make.//I (21NB) work as a cashier at a supermarket. My manager (27F) says Jesus Christ whenever she gets frustrated and after a few weeks of that I started responding with, &quot;Where!?&quot; I make a show of it, open my eyes really wide, look around quickly. She gets a kick out of it and it's sort of our thing now. I do the same with other co-workers and managers but my one co-worker (17F) got annoyed with it and I guess it's been building up for a while since she finally snapped at me the other day. She said, &quot;Stop doing that, that's so annoying.&quot; I responded with, &quot;OK, Sorry. I won't do it with you.&quot; She says, &quot;No. Stop doing it period. I can hear you every time you do it and it's super annoying.&quot; I backed away from her after that and only planned on not doing it with her but now that I've had time to think, maybe I should stop doing it all together.

		<content>Hi all. I’m (40M) a senior designer of a very small company. I’ve been overwhelmed with work and about six months ago, we hired someone to be my junior. I’m not technically her “boss,” but as her senior, I basically act as a substitute for one.//I was a little suspicious of this girl (24F) because she seemed to have different experience than someone who would’ve wanted to apply for this role (she majored in UI/UX), but we had a lot in common and she seemed friendly. I used to work as a team lead for a game design studio and managed a bunch of younger employees who kind of saw me as a “team dad,” and she reminded me of the kids who used to work for me there. My last role was more competitive, but my wife is pregnant and I wanted to take an easier job to help her out with the pregnancy/baby.//I wanted to ease her into things, but apparently she had some training scheduled for UI/UX person during her “down time.” We don’t have “down time” here. I saw she had a meeting on her calendar with him for after work hours, so I told her she didn’t have my permission to do that. She said she had finished all the design work, but that’s only because I was shielding her from the harder work. I’m the one having to do the difficult projects and she’s not even a little thankful that I’m saving her from having to work weekends. I didn’t tell her do these tasks, but as an adult, it’s her job to take initiative and volunteer.//I’ve tried to look out for her best interests and be a friendly boss, but I also have to remind her that I’m in charge. During a meeting, when I was having a really horrific day (mostly because I was picking up work she should be doing + stress of my wife’s pregnancy), I snapped and called her a bitch. (Note that I’ve never called a woman this in my entire life—it wasn’t a gendered insult, that word just came out instead of something like “asshole.”) She looked upset and ended the call without even saying bye. I know it was unprofessional of me, but I’ve been called much worse than that in previous jobs and I assumed she’d get over it. I was friendly with her via IM the rest of the day but she didn’t reply.//I got an email from HR saying that she had requested us (me, her, and HR) to meet about this “incident.” I’m not sure what to do. My wife is saying that calling her a bitch was crossing a line, even if she’s lazy and doesn’t want to do her job, and I can see that it wasn’t the right move. But going to HR seems way out of line. I know that I shouldn’t have insulted her, but I feel like overall, she’s consistently been the problem here. AITA?</content>

		<content>I (30F) work as a financial advisor at a rather large and well known firm, along with my co-worker &quot;T&quot; (mid-20s/F).//One lunch time T was having a discussion with us about how she had started an OnlyFans and was already getting subscribers. She said they should forget about slaving away at a desk for a company and take their future into their own hands, etc.//T then told me I should try it. I brushed this off, and said it's just not something I'd like to do. She asked me why, and I shrugged and said &quot;just because&quot;. It's like asking me if I'd like to become an actress or a doctor, neither appeal to me. However, T didn't see it that way, and said &quot;what, do you think you're better than me?&quot; I said no, of course not, I just wouldn't consider doing sex work as a career.//T took great offense, saying that if I'm happy earning peanuts working my life away for a boss just for &quot;dignity&quot; then that's on me, and I mustn't judge her for wanting to make a better future for herself, that she's not ashamed of what she is doing. She also said &quot;when your children ask you why they were poor their whole lives you can tell them it's because you had too much dignity to provide for them more.&quot;//(I have two children, and I am fully able to provide for them; this pissed me off). She got up and went back to her desk. At this point one of my other colleagues (in a much higher, managerial position) had overheard her and asked me what had happened, so I told her. After all, T's words were she wasn't ashamed of what she was doing, she seemed very open about it. My colleague said nothing and we went back to work. I thought nothing more of it, though I was irritated by T's comments about my children and financial status. I put most of my earnings into my home, family and investment. I drive a pretty standard looking vehicle and my dress sense is rather plain, I guess.//About a week later I noticed T was no longer coming into work. One of the girls she hung out with a lot at lunch time was shooting me angry looks and speaking in hushed tones to their usual group. When I sat down, the girl turned to me and said &quot;Are you pleased with yourself?&quot; I asked why and she said &quot;We all know you told the boss about T's OnlyFans account to get her fired&quot;. I was taken aback, then remembered mentioning it to my colleague that day. I went to her office to ask what had happened.//She told me that she had decided to investigate T's social media, which listed our company as her workplace on her profile. Her IG was full of risque photos to push her OnlyFans. As her IG and FB profiles were easily connected, my colleague said it was openly moonlighting in a way that did not reflect well on the company, and reported it. T was called in to a meeting, which ended in her being dismissed.//I now feel responsible for T losing her job. Her friends have branded me an asshole, telling everyone I'm a jealous bitch, a slut-shamer etc. My colleague told me T had it coming and I must not feel bad.//Reddit, AITA?</content>

	<item label="YTA" title="AITA for firing an employee returning from maternity leave?" op_gender="nan" target_gender="F" experience="higher" relationship="superior" industry="professional" condition="no" action="disciplinary/professional action" intention="exercising authority" impact="career consequences" good_standing="nan" perspective="Yes">
		<content>I feel like the devil right now, so I’ll accept whatever judgement you all have.//I run a team of about 6 people. Our company offers a large amount of maternity leave, 10 months. One of my employees got pregnant recently, i’ll call her Jess.//Our team does project based work and in the period between her leaving for ML we finished up the project we were working on when she left, and started working on a project without her.//During this period, our team had to adapt to working without her expertise in certain matters. We adapted and eventually some of us developed the skills needed to do some of her workload.//The situation we have now is me, and 2 others split half the work that Jess used to do, and we hired someone new to come in to the team to handle the other part of Jess’s workload and then some.//This new employee came at significantly reduced cost, as he was straight out of Uni and we pay him a fraction of what Jess costs currently.//Now Jess has come back to the team, but there is another issue.//Our firm has informed us that for some fucking reason we no longer have the budget for a 7 person team, and will have to let someone go. This news came about when I submitted the paperwork for Jess’s return.//We are 5 months into a project that should take an estimated 10 months, and my decision came down to Jess and the man we hired to replace her. The reason we hired a replacement, which is not normally what we do, is because we anticipated that for this project the workload would be far greater than our current capacity, which it is not.//As you can tell by the title, I chose the replacement. I did so for the following reasons://Far cheaper, thus freeing up a lot more money than keeping Jess on//He was up to date with the project and we would be able to move forward seamlessly, whereas with Jess we would have to take time catching her up to speed on half the project//The clients already knew and liked working with him, whereas they didn’t know Jess at all//She has been out of the field for a prolonged period, whilst he has been here for the past 9 months, so she may, or may not, find it hard to adapt back to work life, whilst with him it isn’t a question//He performed his work better than she did hers and interacted better with the team.//Obviously, the ideal situation which I wanted was to keep both and not put a new single mother with no other job lined up out in the cold, but I had to do right by the team and firm. I told her I’d write her a brilliant Letter of Recommendation, and that in a few months she could try and apply for a job at our firm, hopefully we’ll have the budget, but she snapped at me and told me not to bother, and called me a cunt and left.//I know I sound cold and heartless but I had to be fair to both employees, not just Jess, right?//AITA?</content>

	<item label="NTA" title="AITA for telling my boss that my co-worker wasn't actually sick, but was just taking a &quot;mental health day&quot;?" op_gender="nan" target_gender="F" experience="higher" relationship="same" industry="professional" condition="no" action="disciplinary/professional action" intention="self advancement or interest" impact="career consequences" good_standing="nan" perspective="No">
		<content>I work for a medium sized company. My job position is quite busy and there is a lot to get through every day, but we make it work. I have been there for three years.//In April we hired a new person to the department. She seems to be capable enough, although I have noticed from April that she has taken about a dozen sick days on top of her paid vacation which she took this summer. At first I figured it was no big deal, as people get sick and I didn't know what she was going through, but over time I began to notice a pattern. She almost always takes Monday off, usually when we are going to be slammed with a whole bunch of work. She comes in on Tuesday looking unwell in the morning, but by lunch time she has made a miracle recovery. The other times she took Friday off, which usually aren't as busy as Mondays.//On Monday morning I got to work, and as is often the case, she had called in saying she had a fever. This Monday was going to be particularly brutal because it was the end of the quarter and we could have really used her help. I worked for twelve hours and we barely finished our work inside of the department, and when I got to my car that evening I noticed she had texted me in the morning://Hey! I'm going to take a mental health day today. Do you mind doing [task that takes between 30 minutes and an hour] for me? Thanks!//I was just disgusted at this point because of all of the late days I had to work, she was at the center of so many of them. Maybe she was sick before, but I frankly didn't believe it any more and figured she was just taking more &quot;mental health days.&quot;//I told my boss what she texted me and he responded that he'd handle it in the morning. Well, first thing the next morning, she comes in looking on the verge of death as is her usual act, and he calls her into his office. Apparently he told her that he knew about her mental health days and that he was fed up with her playing hooky because she knew we were going to be busy.//After that she gave up the sick act and began loudly complaining about me to everyone in the office. At lunch time she was waiting for me at the door to the cafeteria and confronted me about how shitty what I did was, so I simply responded that she shouldn't pass her work onto other people because she was too lazy to come in. She got visibly furious and embarrassingly yelled &quot;MENTAL. HEALTH. DAY.&quot; in front of everyone at me, then went back upstairs.//I don't know what people think about this because nobody really wants to step in the crap that's in the middle of our office, but I'm getting a lot of sideways looks. I don't feel like the asshole here but I could be wrong.</content>

		<content>I am 40s/m and &quot;Beth&quot; is 30s/f. We both work in a roughly equivalent station in our office.//Beth has always been a closed book about her personal life, and lately some interactions made me wonder what was going on behind the scenes. I was able to find several of her accounts online, including socials and forums. These were easy enough to find with Google and a bit of conjecture.//I discovered that Beth is very vocal on several platforms about her severe personality disorder and drinking problem. Many concerns I had before, clicked into place: the long history of Monday morning sick days, the mediation processes which always seemed to end in her favor (which were clearly due to manipulation related to her disorder), the way she always seemed to be able to wheedle extra attention and special privileges from supervisors.//I reported this information to our direct supervisor. From my point of view, he certainly has the right to know about anything that impacts the workforce he manages. It seems like he thought I did the right thing and was grateful to hear this information, but I have since told several other co-workers and they have unanimously said I invaded her privacy and other not-so-pleasant accusations. In the main I think I took the right action, but AITA?</content>

		<content>I (17F) have worked at a small deli in my town for the last 3-months or so. It's my first job and my duties that were given to me when I was hired was to work the register and answer the phone. I'm not old enough to legally work the slicers or other equipment so there isn't a whole lot else I can do anyway.//A few days ago, I was working with 2 other people when the assistant manager decided to stop in to do some paperwork or something. I was just standing around at the front desk since there were no customers. When the assistant manager came in one of my coworkers was in the kitchen making salads and the other was slicing some meat, so I was the only one not doing anything.//The AM went to the office for a bit and came back out after about a half hour and asked me what I was doing. I told him I was just waiting for customers or for the phone to ring and he told me to grab a broom, start wiping tables, clean the bathroom, do something other than just standing around.//He said I'm not getting paid to just stand around all day, so I might as well do some cleaning. I told him I wasn't hired to clean and asked him why he asked the only female on shift to do the cleaning. He said he didn't care if I was a female or not, I was the only one standing around doing nothing and so he gave me something to do.//I told him nothing in my job description says anything about sweeping floors or cleaning bathrooms and told him I wasn't doing it. He said he didn't have time to fight me about it so if I was going to refuse to do anything other than stand around, I might as well clock out and head home. So I did.//Later that night I got an email from the manager/owner telling me that she wants to have a meeting with me to discuss what happened. I emailed her back with my side of the story, but she replied that she would prefer to have this discussion in person.//Before the meeting I found the paperwork I was given when I was hired outlining my job description and reread it. Of course, there was nothing in there about cleaning so I took it with me to the meeting.//My boss took me into her office and let me give my side of the story and I presented her with the paperwork of my job description. She stopped me before I could finish and told me she knows what she hired me to do. But she also said that she hired me to be part of a team, not to just stand around doing nothing. She also said she didn't appreciate that I pretty much called her assistant manager sexist when all he did was try to give me something to do.//She gave me a written warning and now I'm pretty much one mistake away from being fired. I don't think I did anything wrong, and I think the AM might have told a different version of what actually happened, but I can't prove it. This is my first job and I'm still learning, but I also really like having money of my own and don't want to get fired.</content>

		<content>Sorry, it's a long story. TLDR at the bottom.//I started at this new company about a year ago, and I've been doing very well. There have been hints dropped that once my current supervisor leaves, I would take her position (she's been talking about moving out of state for a while).//I was excited about that idea because her position is &quot;regional&quot; and I would love to have that title on my resume.//Well, she gave notice and is leaving on June 6th. I was asked if I wanted to take on some of her responsibilities. When I asked about the title and pay, I did not receive a response.//Two days passed, and the main boss man calls me, essentially saying that I didn't show proper appreciation for the offer and that my response was tactless. He then tells me a story about how he once took a pay decrease in order to get more experience. My response was that I already knew about the responsibilities he expected me to take on, I knew the location, I knew the coworkers. The only questions I had were the ones I asked, and I was direct in order to save time, because I know they need to fill that role quickly.//He then said that he's not going to just give me the regional role, that I need to pay my dues. The position they would move me to now would pay another $2-$3/hour. He and I both know that the workload increase is worth a minimum of $5-$7/hour.//I reminded him that I am essentially already filling the role as regional, and that just because I've only been with this company for a year, does not discredit the prior experience I have. He asked if I wanted the position, and I said that my current job is perfect for me, and he would have to bribe me out of it.//He's upset with me because he assumed I wanted the role, since hints had been dropped for a while now and I seemed eager to take it. But, he never directly asked me about it, so... isn't that kind of on him?//I feel justified and proud of myself for not allowing myself to be taken advantage of, but I do feel bad that I am not doing what was expected of me.//TLDR: Boss tried to give me more responsibilities with no title change and a tiny raise to absorb a position that is worth a much bigger raise and title boost. I am not going along with it as he expected, and now he's upset with me.</content>

		<content>Ok so the title may not make sense so to explain I work at an insurance firm and I’ve worked here for about 4 years. I got this job completely out of luck considering how under qualified I was. Recently some bad allegations about the company have come out which led to a whole new change of managers and a lot of my coworkers have recently started complaining about mistreatment from the new supervisors. I personally haven’t had anybody mistreat me. Well all my coworkers teamed up and staged a protest or something..? and the company sent out any email saying anybody participating will be terminated/written up so obviously that day I just did my work in the empty office while my coworkers were outside proving a point? Well a few days after the office stayed empty and I guess majority of the people there were terminated because of a clause in the job offer we all signed about things this. Since then I’ve gotten many text messages saying I’m fake for not joining them and I’m the reason everyone got fired. I told my friends the story and they said I did the right thing I have myself to support... but when I told my sister who thinks she’s an activist she told me It’s lame I didn’t support them and that I should resign since they treat people bad and they’re eventually going to shift that on to me.

		<content>So during one of my fap sessions while browsing through the blonde amateurs sections I was shocked to find a video of a girl from my office. The video was pov and kinda dark but you could definitely tell it was her. So later that night I went to dinner with one of my friends from work and just randomly in conversation I told him look what I found. He was shocked as well since she was a preety nice girl and we'd never expect something like this from her. So I guess from there the video spread like wildfire and the girl eventually found out and apparently had a breakdown and sobbed at work.//Tl;Dr- Found a porn video of a girl from work, told a friend, he told someone else and then it spread. Girl ended up breaking down and crying at work.</content>
