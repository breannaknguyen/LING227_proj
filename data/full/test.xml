		<content>I am a relatively new store manager for a small store for a large retail chain, 3 employees plus myself, and I have a team member who has been with the company less than 3 months. When we hired her, she said she had full availability to work Monday through Saturday. We are closed on Sundays.//After being hired, the team member then revealed she can only work two Saturdays every month. I was OK with this request, as I generally rotate my shifts so no one is working every Saturday, and no one is constantly working nights.//However, after accepting this , each month she has requested off one of her Saturdays, and then requested to be off every Thursday through Saturday for the next 6 weeks for family events and vacations. I declined her request, saying we can't accommodate that kind of schedule from a full-time employee who hasn't even accrued any vacation time, and we have other team members who are taking vacation during that time, to which she responded whether I schedule her or not, she won't be coming in.//After that comment, I told her that if she is refusing to work the schedule I put out, I would need to speak with HR about terminating her employment.//AITA for refusing to accommodate an employee's request to only work Monday-Wednesday for 6 weeks</content>

		<content>Alright, throw away account, mostly because I’m at work and can't remember what my actual login is.//I (25F) have been pretty skinny all my life. I eat healthy most of the time, exercise regularly, not consume my weight in PopTarts (a real problem in college). I also don't think I’m better than fat people. I think obesity is a complex issue and merely reducing the obesity epidemic to ‘Move More, Eat Less’ doesn’t take into account the socio-economic complexities, mental health issues, physical health issues, etc. I don’t make comments like ‘OMG I’m so fat’ when I eat a slice of cake. I don’t talk about going on diets. I don’t judge other people’s food choices. I don’t really care about what you eat.//About 6 months ago, a coworker named “Diane” (40F) transferred to our office (we are “essential” so no work from home). She’s overweight and has constantly made remarks about my food choices. If I eat a salad, she’ll talk about how I have an eating disorder and promote toxic diet culture. She’ll say my body is ‘unnatural’ and ‘real women’ have curves. One time she even tried to make a case that the reason I’m still single is because men don’t find my skinny body attractive. Sometimes, though, she’ll do a complete 180. She’ll make remarks about how it ‘must be nice’ to be young with a metabolism like mine, or to have genetics that allow me to eat whatever I want without gaining an ounce. Lady, weren’t you just calling me anorexic yesterday because I had a salad for lunch? This constant harassment has really been getting to me. I feel like I can’t eat in the office anymore.//I have tried to get this to stop. I have told her firmly to stop. I have told her politely to stop. I have ignored her. I even went to HR and was told this ‘wasn’t harassment’ so they ‘couldn’t do anything about it’.//Well, this all came to a head today. Ever since my first job, I have brought in ‘Spoopy’ Rice Krispie treats on the first day of October. They’re just dyed orange and green with pumpkin and Frankenstein faces on them. I grabbed one and Diane said ‘I wish I could eat like you and still look like you.’//I said, “If you ate like me you probably would look like me’ Grabbed another and walked back to my desk. Honestly, I didn’t feel like I was the asshole, until another co-worker said that what was extremely hurtful to Diane. When I pointed out that she had been bullying me since she got here, the co-worker told me it wasn’t the same. That it would be like using a racial slur against an African American bully. I went too far because I can’t possibly understand the discrimination overweight women face and I should have found another way to deal with it. I’ll admit, having never been fat myself, I don’t know the full extent of discrimination against fat people and I DO NOT want to stoop to the levels of bigots. But how else am I supposed to deal with this?//So, random strangers on the internet, AITA?</content>

		<content>I'm posting this at the request of my teenaged daughter.//I own a restaurant, and employ around 5 girls that work most nights. The employee in question (M) has been working with me for 6 years (my senior employee) and works 6 nights a week. She's an excellent and reliable worker, I even make her temporary manager when I can't make it into work a few times a year.//Last week, during the night with myself and two other girls, M got a call from her brother saying he had accidentally left their 4yo sister at home by herself, and he and their parents (I dont know where they were) wouldn't be back for at least two or three hours. Of course, M panicked and told me that she had to leave. I initially was hesitant, but M wouldn't stop begging and even offered to not receive payment for the hours she had worked this week.//I accepted then and she went home to look after her sister.//When i told my daughter what had happened, she was shocked that I had agreed to not pay M. My view is that M was the one who wanted to go home for the 'family emergency' and she event SUGGESTED not getting paid. My daughter called me an asshole and stubborn, and a few other words I have punished her for.//TL;DR - An employee of mine wanted to leave early because of a family emergency and said she didn't want to be paid for the week if I let her leave early.

		<content>I have a coworker who comes to me for assistance. That's fine.//However, when I'm on &quot;Do Not Disturb&quot; in Teams, he will send me multiple emails or call me on my phone. It's never anything important, just minor stuff that could wait until my meeting(s) are over.//I've talked to him three or four times, telling him that he needs to either wait, or if he must email me it has to stop at one and I'll reply to him when I can. He's sent emails every few minutes asking for an answer. If I decline his call, he'll call right back.//He's been talked to by management about this.//Last week, I sent him a terse email when he emailed me several times during an important meeting. &quot;STOP. I've told you I'll get back to you when I can. If I'm on Do Not Disturb, that doesn't mean 'unless your name is Joe'. This is the last time I'll be polite.&quot;//Finally, he emailed me again on Monday. Multiple times. So, I replied with something along the lines of &quot;Do you know how to fucking read? Have you listened to a goddamn thing I've said? Do not disturb means leave me the fuck alone. We've had polite conversations about this, but I'm going to be more blunt: FUCK. OFF. You're actively hindering my work.&quot;//Note: He's not trying to bait me, he's just thinks that he should be able to get an answer right away from a person.//He and a few coworkers claim I was an asshole and out of line for swearing at him and being &quot;demeaning&quot;.//AITA?</content>

		<content>Hi, first time here, please be gentle!!.//So I, 28F am an employee working for a large company with several departments. There's this new guy that I see often at the reception from another department. He's good looking, wears nice suits, but his socks are just...they look weird. They're colorful and have patterns and animals and totally don't match what his wearing. Like they really stand out and you can't help but notice them.//He's been here for 2 months and has been basically wearing those unmatching socks religiously. Some of my colleagues laughed at him but they don't know him and rarely see him so no harm in that.//Last week, I was in a meeting with him and other employees from different departments. I sat at the corner but still couldn't help staring at his socks and trying to contain my laughter. He noticed but didn't say anything til he caught me looking at them again. That's when he sort of snapped and said &quot;you've been looking at my feet and laughing, is there a problem?&quot; . I finally just let out a laugh and said &quot;I'm sorry but it's just these penguin socks&quot; everyone stared at them then laughed. He looked around then immedietly went back to the project. Let me just say that it got awkward for everyone til the meeting ended.//He waited for me outside the office then pulled me aside and said that those socks I was laughing at had a huge value to him because, his late wife made them before her passing and he's been wearing them for a year now. I was stunned I said I was sorry for his loss and I was kidding...though I was kinda not because, I really thought those socks looked stupid and unmatching with his overall appearance. Plus, they make him look unprofessional and ruin his professional look. He said what was unprofessional is me going off topic and commenting and making fun of something so personal. He implied that he'd take this to HR someday soon which I thought was huge overreaction on his part. though, I don't really think he'll go through with his passive threat. He turned around and walked off.//I felt so terrible, I went back to my department and told my colleagues what happened. They told me he's egotistical and deserved the embarrassement because what did he expect when he decided to wear stuff like that and get attention, besides it wasn't like I made direct comments about the socks I just laughed quietly and did my best not to let it show and he brought it up....Gosh! I just....this entire situation made me nausous because he seemed like a nice guy but I think we got off the wrong foot sort of speak and maybe I was wrong, maybe he flew off the handle.//AITA though?</content>

		<content>I work as a security guard. I was scheduled to start working at this new store today, starting from 10AM - which I guess is when the store opens. I get there at exactly 10AM, and ask to place my belongings in the backroom. I was in the room for a few minutes max, and then came back out to man the door. However, in that time I guess many customers had already come in and one of the sales staff had to play security.//On my lunch break, the manager of the store approached me and asked if next time I could come to a little bit earlier next time so that by the time I put all my belongings down I can be in front of the store at 10AM. I told her no, that if I'm rostered to start at 10AM then I will show up at 10AM, and that if they want me to come earlier then the store would have to arrange that with the security company. I'm not getting paid to come earlier so I really don't see why I'm required to.//She got huffy with me and said that the sales staff aren't trained to be security, and with the popularity of the store every morning there will be people lining up waiting to go inside, and that I needed to be here earlier because of that. She said that it really wasn't hard to come a few minutes earlier, and that it wasn't fair to come &quot;just on time&quot;. I know it's not hard to come a little earlier, but I feel it's more about the principle - if you want someone to come earlier then make that clear through the hours.//I told her such and she just sighed and walked away. We didn't talk for the rest of the day.//So AITA for coming into work &quot;just on time&quot;?</content>

		<content>I work in IT, I am the Team lead and senior tech. I was told last minute that IT needs to work a meeting that they failed to include us in on. This is a consistent trend in the company people expect others to read minds when they don’t send invites. I for the last two years have showed up at mostly every meeting last minute after hours. I am not the only tech in IT but i am the only one who is always able to support last minute meetings.//I have had enough of the last minute meetings after hours. They let me know around 4:30 (i get off at 5) sometimes that there will be a 6 to 8 meeting you need to stay for. Which is insanely inconsiderate.//I decided enough is enough. I said nope and had another tech stay. I support every single meeting, I have plans, I cannot cancel. The CIO yelled at me saying my job is to be flexible.//I ended up making the tier one tech stay who has a kid he needed to pick up. Who is also a single father. Part of me feels bad, but on the other hand the tier one tech i made stay usually doesn’t contribute to much and skips works for a week on end without telling a single person. He has also never stayed for a single meeting and always uses the excuse he’s a single father who needs to pick his child up to get out of everything. Am I the asshole for making him stay or not supporting my office last minute?</content>

		<content>Hi on mobile and throwaway//I (24f) am autistic and work in a retail store for adults. I usually work at night and the closing shift has duties that we do before we close the store. Usually we have me and 2 other people closing up. The duties for the closing shift are all things that drive me insane such as vacuuming, sweeping, cleaning the glass cases and mopping. My sensory issues cause me to not do these duties and I just stick to filling the bags.//Last night we were busy and had to start on our duties later than usual and this meant we had to stay longer in the store. My coworker &quot;Tonya&quot; (26F) was visually upset and I asked her what was wrong? She said it wasn't fair I only did one thing every night and that we all had sensory issues we put aside to help out and I should push past them too so we could all go home quicker. This upset me because no one ever takes my autism seriously and in the moment I called her an ableist jerk who has no right in making any requests for me to do anything. She froze and when I walked away, my coworker said she was quietly crying to herself while mopping.//Did I cross the line or was I right to defend myself? AITA?</content>

		<content>I work as an event coordinator at an establishment I'd rather not name. My job is to sell/ create events for kids birthday parties, adult events, et.//Our boss used to allow all the overtime we wanted. But a few weeks ago, she sent us a text saying, &quot;Moving forward. No one is permitted to work outside of their scheduled times. We are no longer able to have over time.&quot;//Most of our sells are done over the phone, but sometimes people will come in-person to tour the facility and to discuss the event they want to have. These conversations can take anywhere between 30 minutes all the way up to an hour sometimes.//Sometimes, a customer will come in to book an event when I'm clocking out. But even if we were allowed over time, I have a life outside of work. I cannot stay 30 minutes late at a moment's notice.//Tonight, it was just my boss and I in the office and it was 6:59pm (I get off at 7pm) when a family walks in to book a birthday party. So I politely asked the family to take a seat and to wait one moment. Then I went into my boss's office to ask her if she would like to see the family or if she would rather I take their info and call them tomorrow morning.//She got mad and said she couldn't believe I've been, &quot;turning people away&quot; instead of staying late to help them. I apologized and told her I know we aren't allowed to work overtime any longer and I told her that I couldn't stay late tonight because I had plans (that was a lie).//So she started helping them (I heard her tell them the office was closed though) and I clocked out and got in my car.//Soon after I left, she calls me to complain about what I did. I politely explain to her that I schedule my personal life around the schedule she gives us and I cannot stay late at a moment's notice because I have things going on outside of work. I also referenced the fact that she told us we are no longer allowed to go over 40 hours.//She said we'll have to change my schedule around so that I can stay late when I need to. I asked her if she was going to cut my hours (something she just did to my co-worker because she was mad at him) but she said she'll have to make my shifts different times. I told her that even if I get off at 5pm, if I have to be somewhere after work, I wont be able to stay late.//She said she has to do what's best for the company and that we'll have to have a conversation tomorrow. So I took a screenshot of the text she sent us telling us that overtime is no longer allowed.//I have never been late for work and I never leave early. During our last 2 meetings she told me that I've been doing a great job. So I think it's more than reasonable that I leave when my shift is over. Those are the hours we agreed to, so those are the hours I'm prepared for.//TLDR: My boss is pissed at me for not staying late today after I told her I had plans and she told us we aren't allowed to have overtime.</content>

		<content>Ok, I don’t know what to think of this issue, so my plan B is asking reddit, also I’m not a native English speaker so I apologize for grammar or redaction mistakes.//I(M31) work as a manager to a small lab that does some material testing, me team consists of 4 people: Amy, Sarah, John and Mike all of them are between 25-30 years old. I don’t have much experience in management and was chosen because of my technical and budgeting abilities so I was thrilled that my team was a small one. I’ve been working in this company for the last 8 years but only 3 as a manager. Since I’ve had the same crew for 3 years we’ve become close and in general we had a very chill environment up until last May when the bathroom problems begin.//Our lab only had 2 non-gendered bathrooms to share between us 5, still eventually the bathrooms became unofficially gendered meaning there were no labels on them but one was only used by the female members and other by males.//Back in May John really needed to go but the “men’s bathroom” was occupied so he used the “woman’s bathroom” I noticed but didn’t think much of it since it really seem an emergency and in reality anyone could use them, however Amy and Sarah got angry and asked for the bathroom to become officially separated, we talked as a team and agreed to do so, John apologized and we moved on, a few week later John used the bathroom again, the woman took notice and issued a complaint, Johns defense was that he had been having stomach problems and was recently discovering he could no longer tolerate certain food and the males bathroom was busy so he had no choice, Amy and Sarah were not taking it and demanded I write him up, I tried to convince them that maybe a warning was enough since it was the first incident since the bathroom policy changed, they were not happy and sent an email to corporate who then proceed to scold me and asked me to take this kind of stuff seriously so I had to write John up.//This completely changed work environment as if an invisible wall had been lifted between men and woman and between employees and management (me), when I told my wife she told me to not become like Michael from the office and to not forget that at the end of the day this is a workplace.//A few weeks passed and for some reason now the situation was reversed, and Amy had to use bathroom but since it was occupied she had to use the men’s room and it was a déjà vu with roles inverted, I talked with the guys saying it was a first offense so we could do with just a warning but no, they wanted revenge and I didn’t want to be scolded again so I wrote Amy up and now work environment sucks. After 3 years of great site performance and work environment a bathroom incident brought us down.//A few friends told me since I’m the manager I should have done better and found a better solution than to write Amy up and therefore I’m the asshole. I admit I’m a novice manager so it might be the case so reddit, am I the asshole?</content>

		<content>My husband and I have, both 33, have been together since college. Over the years, he's had quite the career trajectory. He's a quant PM and makes like 10x what I make (and I make a good salary haha!). As we've grown wealthier, I've learned that people become nosier. Friends, acquaintances, relatives, you name it. In the beginning I would entertain the nosy questions, but since I turned 30, I've adopted a &quot;take no shit&quot; attitude. When people ask me how much he makes, I no longer say anything. I've learned the hard way that giving an exact number can have bad consequences.//My co-worker, 25, is new and she already has quite the reputation. Very chatty, catty, gossipy, you get the gist. You can just tell she craves wealth and status. She wears a bunch of flashy designer items and is always asking the ladies around the office which of the men are single.//Last Friday, our office hosted an afternoon happy hour. She approached me and asked how me and my husband's recent vacation to Europe went. I told her it went well and briefly summarized what we did. Then the conversation went something like this://Her: &quot;So what does your husband do?&quot;//Me: &quot;He works in finance.&quot;//Her: &quot;Oh wow, he must make a ton then to be taking you on all these lavish vacations! I hope you don't mind me asking, but how much does he make in a year??&quot;//Me: &quot;Yes, we're very lucky that he makes a good salary.&quot; Polite smile//Her: &quot;Oh c'monnn I won't tell anyone. How much does he rake in a year? Millions??&quot;//Me: Awkward chuckle &quot;I'd rather not say, but it's up there!&quot;//Her: &quot;What, he doesn't allow you to give an exact number or something??&quot;//Me: Visibly annoyed &quot;No, I just prefer not to say.&quot;//Her: Laughs in my face &quot;You'd think the stuck-up one would be the one with money, not the one without!&quot;//Me: &quot;You should learn how to take 'no' for an answer and when to quit being a nosy bitch. It's a valuable lesson.&quot;//Then I smiled at her and walked away. Later on, I had a few co-workers reach out to me and say that she was crying and left early and that I should apologize for calling her a rude name. I refused. I told my mom and she said I was too rude to the new girl and that she's young and might not fully understand &quot;salary talk&quot;. I think she's old enough. Husband is fully on my side but said maybe I should fake apologize for the sake of office politics, which I somewhat agree with. But still, AITA?</content>

		<content>I work with a team of 10ish people, and we're all WFH for the foreseeable future. My company has gone above and beyond to cater to the people who have kids, which is totally understandable. Flexible hours, last-minute changes, etc.//We've all done a pretty good job of switching gears here. Most of our Zoom meetings are done within 30 minutes to save everyone the trouble. We do weekly one-hour check-ins to make sure everyone know what everyone's up to, if anyone needs help, etc.//Jamie has three kids. Two of them are old enough to where they're doing virtual school, and are polite. The third kid, the youngest, however, is in that bratty little kid phase where they make nonstop noise, and if Mom isn't paying attention, it's the end of the world.//We're tried to be accommodating. But every meeting, when it's her time to talk, it's endless screaming and MOM MOM LOOK AT THIS MOM WHY AREN'T YOU PAYING ATTENTION and then &quot;cute&quot; interruptions like the kid getting up in the camera so we see up his nose, yelling HI over and over when she's talking etc.//She's been told a number of times to please make sure she carves this one hour out of her week so we can work together, professionally, as a team. Yet every week she gets all sheepish and &quot;I just can't so no to him&quot; and shit like that.//I finally snapped this week. I'm waiting on a huge project from her, and she needed to explain where she's at so I could be prepared for the hand-off and to take control. In the middle of her explanation, the kid just starts going &quot;WEEEEEEEEEEEEE&quot; as loud as he can in the room, swinging around a toy.//I couldn't hear shit except the &quot;wee!&quot; and I just... I'd had enough and muted Jamie and said &quot;I'm done wasting my time here, let's move on until Jamie finds a closet to lock that kid in so we can actually get some work done.&quot;//Other people on the Zoom call either cracked up laughing or looked uncomfortable. I get it, putting her on the spot like that was rude. But at the same time, forcing the constant &quot;WEEEEEEE&quot; and noisy interruptions and &quot;cute&quot; antics of the kid on your coworkers who are just there to get work done is beyond obnoxious.//Jamie went off crying to our supervisor, who ended up saying essentially the same thing as me, just with more tact. It's been an issue since this all started, and I'm not the only one who has lost their cool with Jamie over it.//However, some of the people with kids (not all of them) have &quot;banded together&quot; to complain that we're putting too much pressure on Jamie and that it's unfair to expect she would be able to &quot;just turn off being a Mom&quot; like that.//All I'm asking for is a for a quick, professional meeting. None of this &quot;WEEEEEEE!!!!&quot; and &quot;cute&quot; interruptions by someone's kids. AITA?</content>

Jeff and Dave(50sM) co-own the business but Dave does the actual day to day running of the business. I introduced myself and my nickname as usual but she immediately said that “Bessie” (not the actual name) would be a better nickname because it comes from the beginning of my name and that she liked it better. I told her I really didn’t like that nickname and wouldn’t answer to it and asked her to please not call me Bessie but she insisted that it was so much prettier and that I just needed to get used to it.//For the next two months she tried to call me Bessie but I completely ignored her whenever she addressed me that way, even when I knew she really needed help with something. She would call my desk phone and say “hey Bessie” I would reply “you have the wrong number there’s no Bessie here” and hang up. She then tried to get some of the employees outside the office to start calling me Bessie, but I quickly shut that down. I usually finish my work early and help them with a lot of tedious little things that aren’t part of my job description and threaten to stop helping them unless they used my preferred nickname.//Friday she decided she was going to get me to respond to Bessie no matter what. We have an open office design but are at opposite ends. She started calling out Bessie in a singsong voice over and over again to try and annoy me enough to respond. Other coworkers got annoyed, most telling her to stop and one Lisa(43F) telling me to just let her call me Bessie already. I refused and she kept calling out Bessie louder and louder, until Dave barged in. He’d been on a conference call with an important client and could hear her yelling from his office down the hall. He told her to be quiet and that if she called me Bessie one more time, he’d write her up and dock her pay.//Later, Megan cornered me in the break room, called me an AH for getting her in trouble and called me Bessie again for good measure just as Dave was walking in to heat up his lunch. He gave her a stern look and said “I warned you.” Then he walked to HR to have her written up. Lisa is saying I’m the AH for never helping Megan and that, if I had been nicer or hadn’t fought her so hard on the nickname, she probably would have given up on it a while ago but because I made such a big deal out of it, it became a challenge. So reddit, AITA?</content>

		<content>I work in the radio industry and had a voice mail left from a company who were trying to get in touch with a colleague of mine about doing some voiceover work, so I made a quick note of it and deleted the message.//Spoke to my colleague in work the following week and told him the information, but he immediately got angry with me for taking so long to tell him, and said voice overs need to be done in the next couple of days.//He flipped out and called me selfish for deleting the message and not having all the information at hand, but I thought he’d know them already. The way I see it I get paid to do my job, shouldn’t have to be running his side gig as a voice over artist, and I told him the message, even if it wasn’t immediately.//AITA?</content>

		<content>Throwaway account because some coworkers know my main.//I (24F) have been working at a small, family-owned restaurant as a server for the past three years. I genuinely love my job, the people I work with, and the regular customers we have. Recently, the restaurant has been struggling financially due to a combination of factors, including the ongoing pandemic and increased competition in the area.//Last week, the owner, who is also the head chef, held a staff meeting. He explained that the restaurant was on the verge of going under and asked if we would be willing to donate some of our tips to help keep the business afloat. He emphasized that it would be a temporary measure and that he would work out a repayment plan for everyone once the restaurant was back on stable footing.//I rely on my tips to cover my living expenses and support my younger sibling, who is still in college. I'm already struggling financially, and giving up a portion of my tips would put me in an even more precarious position. I couldn't believe that the owner would even suggest such a thing, and I got pretty upset during the meeting. I told him that it was outrageous to expect us to sacrifice our hard-earned money when we're all just trying to get by, and I stormed out.//Later, I texted the owner to apologize for my outburst and offered to pick up extra shifts or help out in other ways to support the business. He replied saying that he understood my situation, but he was disappointed in my reaction. Now, I've found out that several of my coworkers have agreed to give up some of their tips, and they're gossiping about me and how I &quot;overreacted.&quot;//I believe I might be the asshole because I reacted angrily in the meeting , which might have been seen as unprofessional and disrespectful towards my employer My coworkers think that I overreacted and that my anger was uncalled for. I'm worried that I might have been too harsh on my employer, who was just trying to find a solution to keep the restaurant afloat.//AITA for getting angry at my employer for suggesting I give up my tips to save the restaurant, even though my coworkers are pitching in and think I overreacted? (2nd post as I don’t think my first went through properly so I needed to reword the original post) I’m still pretty pissed at the whole situation.</content>

		<content>So I'm an engineer and I'm working on a team with 7 decently chill guys and one guy with anger issues. Like he can't just have a respectful disagreement, he'll raise his voice and yell and get up close to your face. I hate it.//So I started by just complaining to my boss about it. And he brushed it under the rug saying he is just like that. And if I thought he was bad now I should of seen him 10 years ago before he &quot;mellowed out&quot;//It makes me wonder what he was like 10 years ago because he sure ain't mellow now.//It's also a small enough company that there's no HR, only the corporate management. Which didn't help.//So I took a different approach. I stopped calling him &quot;angry&quot;, or calling what he was doing &quot;arguing&quot; or &quot;yelling&quot;. I just swapped in the words &quot;emotional&quot; or &quot;throwing a tantrum&quot; or &quot;having a fit&quot;//I was kinda hoping if I could shift his reputation from domineering (big man vibes) to emotional and tantrumming (weak sad baby vibes)//So I started just making subtle comments. Like if I had a meeting with him and he got a temper, I'd mention to the other people &quot;Wow, it's crazy how emotional Jay got. I dunno how he has the energy to throw a hissy fit at 9 am, I'm barely awake&quot;//Or when my boss asked me to recap a meeting he missed, I told him &quot;Dan, Jack, and James had some really great feedback on my report for (this client). Jay kinda had trouble managing his emotions and had a temper tantrum again, but you know how he gets.&quot;//Or when a coworker asked why he was yelling I'd say &quot;Honestly I don't even know, he was getting so emotional about it he wasn't speaking rationally.&quot;//I tried to drop it in subtly and some of my coworkers started picking it up. I don't think consciously, just saying stuff like &quot;Oh, another of Jay's fits&quot; or something.//I got gutsy enough to even start saying to his face &quot;Hey, I can hardly understand what you're trying to explain when you're so emotional&quot;//And again my coworkers started picking up on it and I even caught several of them telling him to get a hold of himself.//After a while, he started to get a reputation as emotional and irrational. Which I could tell pissed him off. But he stopped yelling at me as much.//Anyway, he slipped once this week and I just said &quot;I really can't talk to you when you're being this emotional&quot; and he blew up at me asking why I was always calling him that. I shrugged and said &quot;dude you look like you're on the verge of tears, go look in the mirror before you ask me&quot; and he got really angry I suggested he might start crying. (That was a kinda flippant comment, he was red faced angry not tearful angry, and I could tell.)//I feel like a bit of a dick for being petty and trying to gaslight this guy into thinking everyone around him sees him like a crybaby. But it also mostly worked when the &quot;proper channels&quot; didn't//AITA for calling my coworker emotional when he got mad?</content>

		<content>My husband and I took a much needed vacation to the beach last week and the entire week before we left I sent emails arpund letting everyone know I'd be completely inaccessible for the week so to come and see me for any work materials needed, files etc. I gave everyone everything I knew or thought they'd need and left confident that everyone had prepared themselves, seeing as I'd given them 8 days to prepare.//When I returned I found chaos in the office. Apparently one of my colleagues had needed files for a particularly important client of ours and had not been able to find them in my office and I never responded to calls or emails, as I warned I wouldn't do. This coworker knew they'd be handling this client and had 8 days and 12 hours a day to ask me for all pertinent files and appears to have not.//In any case, I was blamed because the client is technically mine and I am supervisor of this coworker.//I contend that I am blameless because this coworker had 8 days to collect all their files like their other coworkers did and they neglected to do so. No one seems to care about that.//AITA here?</content>

		<content>I(29F) started working at a new company 8 months ago.//I was head hunted specifically for the role I have, which gave me enough power to negotiate my contract like I wanted. One of the things I managed to get was a clause that prohibited my employer from contacting me outside work hours.//If it is a true emergency, then they can send me an email. Otherwise they can't even send me a text.//Furthermore, I have a separate work phone that I shut down at 5 on the dot, then turn on at 9am.//Another thing is that I don't work OT. I am very efficient, so my work is done by 3pm, 5pm if we have an emergency. I also take my whole lunch break outside the office, and my coffee breaks away from my desk.//My coworkers are not the same, they tend to socialize during work hour, and have work left for afterwards.//They sometimes ask me to &quot;help&quot;, but I always decline by saying that I have plans. I don't go into details, I just say that I have plans.//These plans are 99% of the time just include going home, reading books, or sleeping. But that is my personal time.//Monday, a coworker asked me if I could stay a bit later to help her out, apparently she was late with some essential work, but had to be done by that night, because she had to attend her daughter's recital at 6. I said that I was sorry, but that I had plans.//It was a nice day, so instead of going home, I just went to a parc to read while breathing some fresh air. Brought some fruit and bubble tea, and made a picnic out of it.//My coworker found me there, and she was pissed. She said that I could have helped her if I didn't have plans, I said that I do have plans, this impromptu picnic. She said that it wasn't as important as her daughter's recital. So I said that for me, it was even more important than her daughter's recital.//She called me an AH, and some of my friends agree. So AITA?</content>

		<content>For a little backstory, I've worked at my agency for 5 years and worked my way up to manager. I was instrumental in hiring the employee, let's call her Pam. I wasn't her direct supervisor but I was the Director of Compliance for the full agency when we kinda got into a tiff. I sent Pam an email asking her to contact a specific client for a time sensitive matter. She did not respond to my email and when I checked with her later, she said she didn't contact the client because she didn't think it was necessary. I told her she needed to do what I asked her to do and if she has questions about anything to let me know instead of ignoring the directive.//After that, Pam didn't like me. About a year later, another Director position opend up that I applied for and got. I was now Pam's supervisor's boss. My new role was announced about 3 weeks before it was to be effective.//The week before my position started, Pam is out on a week's vacation (approved). On the first day of her vacation, Pam submits her resignation notice giving 13 day's notice. Since she was on vacation, it was impossible to work on transitioning her work for while she was out so we had to do some scrambling.//When she came back from vacation, she learned her health benefits end on her last day rather than at the end of the month. Well, Pam came to me asking if she could extend her last day one extra day and I denied it. She tried to make it seem like she didn't realize she gave 13 day's notice instead of 14. I said her presence was no longer necessary and I accepted her original resignation date.//The end result was she basically cussed me out, sent a mass all-staff email trashing me, left causing a scene, and ended up getting banned from the building. The next day a bunch of people were saying I went too far and it wasn't that serious. I don't think I did anything wrong. Am I the asshole?</content>
