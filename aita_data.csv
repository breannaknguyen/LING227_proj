1,AITA-For ignoring my boss and blocking his number on my vacation?,"My boyfriend (29 m) and I (26 f) are currently long-distance. We take turns visiting each other. He came to see me after almost two months of not seeing each other. We finally were to make plans. I requested to have five days off which was approved from my job. I’ve worked there for six years. I’m a security guard at a department store.//It was after my shift, and I was heading out quickly. I had to pick my bf up from the airport. I clocked out, and while I was saying bye to everyone. My new boss of 2 weeks stopped me, and he asked if I could cover a shift. Since one of my co-workers called in sick. We’re short-staffed, and he needs me to stay for a couple hours more. I had a 10-hour shift. I was exhausted.//I responded no. I’m sorry, but I’m unable to do that, and I can’t stay late. I have covered shifts before in the past. I don’t mind, but I had somewhere to be. I mentioned I was picking up someone at the airport. He told me they could take an Uber. My boyfriend wouldn’t be happy with me if I did to him. Also he has no key to my apartment.//No one else wanted to stay, and I was the third person he asked to that said no. I said sorry, I can’t just tonight, another time.//He called me a lousy worker, and I’m not a team player. I said, guess I’m not a team player and I walked passed him. I called out. I’ll see him in five days. While driving to the airport, I kept getting calls and texts from him; it got so bad that I had to pull over to turn off my phone. My boss wanted me to come back to work.//I had to turn on my phone, so my boyfriend could contact me. My phone was flooded with text messages. Ding after ding I think I got close to 15 texts. I blocked his number.//I was so happy to see my bf. I was getting emails from my boss constantly when I was supposed to be my time off. I didn’t respond to and I rarely take vacation. One, he was asking me stuff that I didn’t know the answer to. Second, even if I did, I’m not telling him. I don’t know; I was starting to get petty.//I still had fun with my boyfriend. When I went to work, my boss called me into his office. He blew up at me for being unprofessional, and he’s still new to this job. I should’ve helped or at least replied to the emails. I responded other people could’ve helped him. It’s not my responsibility when it’s my vacation time. I got my first write-up ever.//Is this something I’m missing? Did I do something inherently wrong here? I’m actually considering to report him. He is still new to his job. Am I the asshole?//Edit: I’m Canadian. I live in BC.//Update: I just sent an email to my HR with all the emails texts call logs. And any other evidence I have. My job isn’t like on call.So I don’t understand why he was bothering me he is my age roughly. On a happier note me and my boyfriend are planning to move in together//Edit: I’m a security guard at a departmental store. I like my job. HR Is setting a meeting up for tomorrow with me and my boss. My boss Tried asking me out in his first week of working But I told him down (nicely).//Edit: Thank you for everyone’s support. When I posted this I thought I was being a little dramatic. I’m glad I’m not the crazy one. I decided that I’m gonna look for a new job. I still wanna do security work but I’m just gonna move on. Don’t worry I’m still going to complain about my boss And report him.//Final update.

2,AITA For not staying late at work when my boss said no overtime?,"I work as an event coordinator at an establishment I'd rather not name. My job is to sell/ create events for kids birthday parties, adult events, et.//Our boss used to allow all the overtime we wanted. But a few weeks ago, she sent us a text saying, ""Moving forward. No one is permitted to work outside of their scheduled times. We are no longer able to have over time.""//Most of our sells are done over the phone, but sometimes people will come in-person to tour the facility and to discuss the event they want to have. These conversations can take anywhere between 30 minutes all the way up to an hour sometimes.//Sometimes, a customer will come in to book an event when I'm clocking out. But even if we were allowed over time, I have a life outside of work. I cannot stay 30 minutes late at a moment's notice.//Tonight, it was just my boss and I in the office and it was 6:59pm (I get off at 7pm) when a family walks in to book a birthday party. So I politely asked the family to take a seat and to wait one moment. Then I went into my boss's office to ask her if she would like to see the family or if she would rather I take their info and call them tomorrow morning.//She got mad and said she couldn't believe I've been, ""turning people away"" instead of staying late to help them. I apologized and told her I know we aren't allowed to work overtime any longer and I told her that I couldn't stay late tonight because I had plans (that was a lie).//So she started helping them (I heard her tell them the office was closed though) and I clocked out and got in my car.//Soon after I left, she calls me to complain about what I did. I politely explain to her that I schedule my personal life around the schedule she gives us and I cannot stay late at a moment's notice because I have things going on outside of work. I also referenced the fact that she told us we are no longer allowed to go over 40 hours.//She said we'll have to change my schedule around so that I can stay late when I need to. I asked her if she was going to cut my hours (something she just did to my co-worker because she was mad at him) but she said she'll have to make my shifts different times. I told her that even if I get off at 5pm, if I have to be somewhere after work, I wont be able to stay late.//She said she has to do what's best for the company and that we'll have to have a conversation tomorrow. So I took a screenshot of the text she sent us telling us that overtime is no longer allowed.//I have never been late for work and I never leave early. During our last 2 meetings she told me that I've been doing a great job. So I think it's more than reasonable that I leave when my shift is over. Those are the hours we agreed to, so those are the hours I'm prepared for.//TLDR: My boss is pissed at me for not staying late today after I told her I had plans and she told us we aren't allowed to have overtime.",NTA,1.000,147,,,,,,lower,inferior,customer-facing or retail,yes,making or declining requests,following rules,strained relationships,Yes,No,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/wfroxp/aita_for_not_staying_late_at_work_when_my_boss/
3,"AITA for calling my hot-tempered guy coworker ""emotional"" to embarrass him into calming tf down?","So I'm an engineer and I'm working on a team with 7 decently chill guys and one guy with anger issues. Like he can't just have a respectful disagreement, he'll raise his voice and yell and get up close to your face. I hate it.//So I started by just complaining to my boss about it. And he brushed it under the rug saying he is just like that. And if I thought he was bad now I should of seen him 10 years ago before he ""mellowed out""//It makes me wonder what he was like 10 years ago because he sure ain't mellow now.//It's also a small enough company that there's no HR, only the corporate management. Which didn't help.//So I took a different approach. I stopped calling him ""angry"", or calling what he was doing ""arguing"" or ""yelling"". I just swapped in the words ""emotional"" or ""throwing a tantrum"" or ""having a fit""//I was kinda hoping if I could shift his reputation from domineering (big man vibes) to emotional and tantrumming (weak sad baby vibes)//So I started just making subtle comments. Like if I had a meeting with him and he got a temper, I'd mention to the other people ""Wow, it's crazy how emotional Jay got. I dunno how he has the energy to throw a hissy fit at 9 am, I'm barely awake""//Or when my boss asked me to recap a meeting he missed, I told him ""Dan, Jack, and James had some really great feedback on my report for (this client). Jay kinda had trouble managing his emotions and had a temper tantrum again, but you know how he gets.""//Or when a coworker asked why he was yelling I'd say ""Honestly I don't even know, he was getting so emotional about it he wasn't speaking rationally.""//I tried to drop it in subtly and some of my coworkers started picking it up. I don't think consciously, just saying stuff like ""Oh, another of Jay's fits"" or something.//I got gutsy enough to even start saying to his face ""Hey, I can hardly understand what you're trying to explain when you're so emotional""//And again my coworkers started picking up on it and I even caught several of them telling him to get a hold of himself.//After a while, he started to get a reputation as emotional and irrational. Which I could tell pissed him off. But he stopped yelling at me as much.//Anyway, he slipped once this week and I just said ""I really can't talk to you when you're being this emotional"" and he blew up at me asking why I was always calling him that. I shrugged and said ""dude you look like you're on the verge of tears, go look in the mirror before you ask me"" and he got really angry I suggested he might start crying. (That was a kinda flippant comment, he was red faced angry not tearful angry, and I could tell.)//I feel like a bit of a dick for being petty and trying to gaslight this guy into thinking everyone around him sees him like a crybaby.

5,AITA for telling my new co worker it was misleading of him to be wearing his wedding band when he's a widower?,"Hi. A couple of weeks ago we had a new employee hired at the company. he's a good guy and a widower named ""James"" (36) and to my knowledge his late wife passed away 8 months ago. Me (f32) and the other coworkers got along well with him. However I noticed that he is still wearing his wedding band on his finger. It kind of confused me a bit and I couldn't help but bring it up with him while on lunch break//We talked and I pointed out that he was being misleading by still wearing his wedding band when he's a widower. He looked quite bothered by what I said but I tried to explain that I think that he was giving people the wrong idea or impression about his relationship status since he's technically single and on his own right now (don't want to sound cruel but I'm speaking from technical angle). James said that he didn't give it much thought (meaning he don't care what people think) and that even if he wasn't wearing his wedding band and some woman approached him he'd still turn them down since he's obviously not interested.//For some reason things got awkward and everyone stopped eating and just stared at James and me. I told him I don't know but that really really felt generally misleading of him as in making people think he is in a relationship (married) when he is not regardless of how he felt about being in a relationship. He got upset, called me rude, and said that I repeatedly disrespected his marriage and his late wife's memory with what I said then took his stuff and walked away. My co workers said regardless of who is right or wrong (though some said he overreacted) there was no reason for me to bring this up on the first place and cause a scene and make James upset with us like that now he's not speaking to me and others who sided with me.//AITA? Did I overstep or did he overreact?//This was just a conversation we were casually having with the other co workers and I didn't use any insensitive tones or anything but we had a discussion and it suddenly turned into an argument.

6,AITA for accidentally calling out a new colleague on lying about her language skills?,"Last week a new colleague ""Cathy"" (33f) started at my (25f) work place. She instantly stood out in the team, because she seems like someone who is very... loud and assertive? Two of my colleagues, me and Cathy were having coffee in the break room (we were the only ones in there and we were sitting far apart), when the subject of travel was brought up. My colleague said she wasn't booking trips anymore because it'll probably get cancelled because of covid anyway. Cathy, immediately cut in about how sad she is because she travels so often and she goes on these far ""exotic"" trips to Europe as her hobby. When I think exotic I think the Bahamas or something instead of Europe but. Cool.//Cathy then jokes about how all this ""no travel business"" is making her fear that she'll lose some of her foreign language skills. I asked what languages she spoke. She claimed to be fluent in 3 European languages, among which were French and Dutch. Cathy said she was ""at a native speaker level"" and went on about how people in Europe were always surprised when they found out she wasn't from there.//I was excited, because I never get to speak Dutch over here. I was raised in Belgium, which has three national languages: French and Dutch (which are my mother tongues and the most commonly spoken there) and German. It's quite common to be pretty fluent in at least two out of the three languages in Belgium, because you're required to learn them at school (along with English) from a young age. I told Cathy ""oh leuk, dan hebben we iets gemeenschappelijk!"" (""oh fun, we have something in common then!"")//She immediately pulled this sour face and asked me if that was supposed to be Dutch. I said yes. She laughed awkwardly and said she ""couldn't understand because I have a terrible accent and must not be that good at speaking it."" Now see, I don't have an accent. I speak Dutch more fluently than I speak English. I told Cathy that I grew up speaking Dutch and speak it to my family all the time.//She got miffed and asked what languages I speak and where I'm from. I told her I'm from Belgium, so I also speak French and I added ""which you just said you speak as well, cool! We can speak French instead!"" I acknowledge that I was a bit of a dick here, because by that point I knew she probably lied about speaking French as well. She then shoved her chair back and angrily got up, said ""whatever"" and stomped off. It was awkward. My other colleagues just kinda shrugged and said she shouldn't have lied.//However, she later approached me and told me I embarrassed her by acting ""superior"" about my European heritage. I told her there was no way for me to know she'd lied about speaking those languages. She rolled her eyes and told me I was immature. A colleague told me that Cathy had called me a ""little b-word who enjoys bullying new colleagues"" behind my back later. I don't think I was a bully at all, but I don't want this to turn into a huge thing. Do I just apologize to keep the peace?

7,AITA for refusing to be on time to work until my boss talks to me about it?,"I work in fast food. I've had this job 6 years, and I've always struggled to be on time. A few months in, I was made a manager. There always needs to be a manager in the building, but at that location, it made no difference if I was late- there were always multiple managers there.//And then I was transferred to my current location. It's smaller, and has a lot less managers. If I was late, someone would be waiting for me to show up so they could leave. After about a week, I sat down with my manager, Eliza, and we made a deal. My schedule was changed so that all of my shifts started an hour earlier. So I had 9 hour shifts, instead of 8, and there was a guaranteed one hour overlap between me and the person before me. And it worked wonderfully. Even being regularly late, I still had the smoothest transitions because of that overlap, and nobody was inconvenienced. The manager before me would also sometimes be able to leave early, which everyone (in particular, Eliza, who was salaried) enjoyed. Eliza even tried to convince the others working my shift to do that as well, but they refused. So it's still an 8 hour shift, with only me working 9 hours.//2 months ago, Eliza got transferred. We got a new manager, John. I don't know how the transition goes, but I assumed that even if he was made aware of it, he would not be willing to continue my deal from before. I've had a second job now for 3 months, and easily worked through my lateness issues there (tardiness isn't punished there, but makes the job much more difficult- the work starts on time, whether you're there or not), and felt like I could do fine with that at my main job as well, as long as we could go back to the 8 hour shifts. But when we got our first schedule made by John, I was still given a longer shift, with an hour earlier start time. I honestly prefer it this way- mostly because it allows me to stress a lot less about when I get there. John seems to like it that way too- he regularly leaves early on my days. So I see no need to bring it up with him. But I'm being told by the other managers (and even some crew) that John complains constantly to them about my lateness.//Am I the asshole for not being on time until my manager addresses it with me?",YTA,0.209,1600,,,M,,6,higher,inferior,customer-facing or retail,yes,cheating or violating company rules,self advancement or interest,disruption to workplace dynnamics,Yes,No,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ty1ace/aita_for_refusing_to_be_on_time_to_work_until_my/
8,AITA for reporting my colleague to HR?,"Background: I (26f) just started my first job after finishing my masters, and work in a dept with another colleague (27f, Thea) who joined the company 2 months before me. She is currently in graduate school, and I'm amazed at how she is very efficient and fast in her tasks.//I noticed that Thea is always assigned complicated tasks despite being new to the company, and I wanted to join the projects that she's in so I can learn from her. Initially, Thea was fine with it, and I learned that she is someone who will implement very strict timelines in order to get things done. I had trouble keeping up because I wasn't used to having such deadlines, but she would just tell me to be faster next time and move on.//Recently, she put up a huge whiteboard at her desk which detailed all her meetings and tasks for the month. I was very impressed with the set-up, and asked her what the tasks on her board meant. She became very irritated when I asked if there was room for one more teammate, and she finally snapped and said 'not everything with my name needs you involved.'//I was surprised at her hostility, but just thought she was having a bad day. But ever since then, she's been very distant and just generally difficult to work with. She wouldn't be as helpful as before when it came to retrieving documents that I need, implemented tougher deadlines, and would just avoid me by going home earlier.//I felt that she was creating an overly hostile work environment that was affecting my productivity, and felt like the right thing to do was to report her to HR. I did so, after collecting some evidence, and HR said that they would talk to her. Well, the talk didn't seem to go well because now our boss has told me to just stay out of her way, and removed me from all projects that involves her. Thea has even been moved to another section in the office, closer to our seniors, who I've heard been trying to placate her to stop her from leaving.//I'm conflicted as I don't want to ruin my workplace relationships.

Small things like that, and I never stress deadlines as long as we're within a week or two of meeting them, I really try to be the easiest person you can work with.//My mentor who made me the salesman I am today sometimes funnels sales through me since he's retired. The company knows, no one has an issue and I owe the guy my professional career so I do these deals for nothing. I do all the legwork, get nothing and pay taxes on the income. It's not much and I'm comfortable so it's not a big deal. I recently closed a sale for him that was a nightmare, I mean the worst customer I've ever dealt with. At one point I had to cut a scheduled vacation with friends to Vegas short halfway through because the sale would have fallen through if I didn't. Again I never mentioned this to anyone just closed the sale. My mentor made more than I've made from any deal on that deal, as always he offered me a cut but I told him there's no way I'd accept it and moved on. While operations don't see what we make on deals, the assumption is usually the bigger the sale the bigger the commission. That's not always the case but they don't know that. When I closed this sale the kid I work with was hinting that he expected a huge bonus from me for this sale. I laughed and told him sorry bud, nothing thing time, I made nothing on this sale. I could tell right away that he didn't like that answer and the conversation ended shortly after that. I assumed he was just bummed, which was fine.//The next day I got a long email from him going on and on about how hard he works, and how he doesn't make a quarter of what I make a year, and if it wasn't for him I couldn't close a single sale. Honestly I skimmed it, forwarded it to his boss and with a single sentence that read ""This can never happen again."" I found out the next day they suspended the guy and are considering firing him. I conveyed to his boss that I liked working with the kid and didn't want to see him fired for 1 mistake but was told that my input wasn't needed.

13,AITA for firing my assistant after she kept making disparaging comments about pregnancy and baby related matters while I (her boss) was actually pregnant?,"Edit for context and info: Yes, my assistant was given multiple warnings both verbally and official written warnings about her inappropriate comments specifically about pregnancy and to a lesser extent, babies and children. Moreover, I’m an employment and labor lawyer and the head of HR is also a lawyer so are careful to make sure everything is done properly. Regarding the eavesdropping matter, her desk is right outside my office so it is conceivable that she could overhear conversations that occur in my office. However, my office doors were shut and my husband and I were speaking very quietly. Hence, I think she intentionally eavesdropped on our conversation. Finally, I realize “unborn fetus” is not an improper term. I don’t like it as used by my assistant bc she uses it interchangeably with any inanimate object and often makes jokes about how an unborn fetus isn’t actually a real person. Thus, her use of that phrase with me was intentional.//I (39F) am pregnant with my first and am very excited by this. However my assistant, who is generally a nice person other than that this quirk, hates all things related to pregnancy, babies, and children.//I recently got in a minor car accident and had to go the hospital to make sure the baby was fine. When my husband dropped me off at my office after this incident, we discussed what we would ever do in a scenario where he would have to choose between me or the baby. I said to my husband that if it’s a choice between me or the baby, please pick the baby. Apparently my assistant eavesdropped or overheard our private conversation. After my husband left, my assistant kept saying she wanted me to understand my worth and that I, as a fully formed person, am clearly worth more than an unborn fetus.//I think probably the combination of having to try constantly to not acknowledge any aspect of my pregnancy around my assistant, her eavesdropping on very personal conversations with my husband, and finally, referring to the my future baby as an unborn fetus was just too much for me to take. Honestly, she’s actually a pretty good assistant other than this hang up she has about all things pregnancy, babies, and kids. But I couldn’t handle being around her anymore and had her terminated.

16,AITA for talking about being food insecure at work,"I (M22) am a substitute teacher. In my district we're paid the legal minimum for the job. If you work more than 15 days at a school you get ""normal"" pay - I only ever get jobs that are exactly 15 days. A few days into my placement, I heard some teachers (both M30ish) in the lounge complaining that bus monitors only get paid $20 an hour, and laughing about how only an idiot would do a job for that little. I make $14.50. I jumped in and told them, they didn't know I was being paid that little.//My monthly grocery budget is $150. An entire paycheck has to go to rent alone, and then the majority of the rest goes to medical expenses (I am permanently disabled), other bills, and gas. I usually have less than $10 total for a few days before my next paycheck. I don't qualify for SNAP. My disabilities make most food pantry items inaccessible (I have anaphylaxis from nuts, honey, peppers, and more). For the past month, thanks to a prescription going up in price, I have been eating once every 24 hours to keep making rent, but for the last 8 months I've been food insecure. I usually cry on the way home because I pass by fast food and know I can't even get a hamburger. I'm almost always so hungry it hurts.//I admit I've got some resentment to my job for paying me so little while the school constantly complains that we don't have enough subs. I've had anger building up over the fact that I'm starving, and they only hire me for the maximum days before they have to pay me more.//Where I might be the asshole://I've started being open about the fact that I'm hungry at work. I never ask for food – just stuff like they'll ask if I can keep a student in the room over lunch, and I'll be chipper/my usual self and reply ""of course, I'll just be reading, I couldn't afford food today."" A teacher I don't know will ask what I packed for lunch and I'll say ""nothing, I can't afford that much food."" Stuff like that. It's always true. I'm careful to not exaggerate.//Recently I was in the library and the librarian asked if I had dinner plans. I said no, I have to skip eating today because I can't afford it. She looked at me weird and said while she won't judge me for being unable to eat, it's very unprofessional to talk about it at work where you're being paid. I told her if it's unprofessional for me to talk about starving it's just as unprofessional to pay me so little I starve. She went quiet and we didn't really talk for the rest of the day.//She got me thinking and I'll admit I don't know if I'm actually being an asshole. I know other staff aren't the ones who pay me so little. But I also feel like my struggle is invisible, and after full time teachers called anyone taking even $20 an hour an idiot, it's really been eating at me (ha).//TL;DR I'm being open about the fact that I'm food insecure at work, and don't feel bad for making the people paid more than me feel awkward.

She pushed back, saying employees should be able to use all of their allotted days off for any reason, otherwise she was being ‘punished’ for not being sick and not taking those sick days off throughout the year.//I ultimately decided to not pay her for her upcoming vacation, because I don’t want to start a new precedent for the whole company to use sick days and PTO interchangeably.//Here is where I’m wondering if I’m TAH. When I told her she would not be paid, she asked if she were to be sick for the same amount of time before the end of the year, would I pay her then?

However, there's this manager at work, let's call her Leanne (~40f) and most of us don't get on with her at all, as she's always humiliating people by talking down to us. For example my coworker has a lisp and last week when she asked him how far along he was with a project he said it would still take another while, she basically blew up at him but half of the time when she was screaming at him, she was putting on a fake lisp to mock him. She'll always leave a pile of work onto other people because she needs to leave work to collect her kids from school when the father doesn't show up to collect them when it's his turn. Another thing is she always expects us to stay on later than expected and coming in earlier, but we don't get paid for this time.//That's just a few examples because if I listed all of the things she's, it would go over the word limit.//So today I got told I'm being promoted to a much higher position within the company, I'm excited about it as it pays better and will give me a lot more responsibility. The thing is this position basically will make Leanne my subordinate. So I was telling a few coworkers about the promotion, we were just standing in the break room laughing and chatting and she came in.//She started giving out about us not working, saying things like 'oh I get it, you guys must think you're on vacation just because its a nice day out do you?', at one point she turned to my Mexican coworker and said 'you shouldn't add to the stereotypes' and eventually said 'if you people don't get your butts back to your office right now, I'm going to report it to higher management'//The more she talked the angrier I got and when she finally finished berating us I stood silently for a second and then just said something like 'I'll consider this being you reporting it to higher management, as that's currently my position in [company]'. One of my coworkers snorted and Leanne looked furious.//Then I just told her that me and my coworkers were okay to be in the break room, as it was literally our break time, that it was pretty rich to tell us we couldn't take a coffee break when she herself would leave work regularly to pick up her kids because her ex husband couldn't be bothered. I said that she wasn't to speak to any of us like that anymore or I'd have her written up within the minute.//She stood there for like a whole minute it felt like and started tearing up, then she left without a word.

25,AITA for my “discriminatory” instructions to my elderly employee?,"Obligatory throwaway notice//I know the title seems absurd, but hear me out.//I (27f) am the head of a childcare-related business. We’re relatively small (only about six employees) but the ones I’ll be mentioning are K (17f) and B (86f).//B, though in excellent shape, is elderly and isn’t able to move around as well as she once did. She often plays with the kids and allows them to be physical with her. We employ her as an as-needed worker, meaning she generally comes later in the day when K is working.//A few weeks ago, B was playing with the children and allowed them to get rough with her (pull on her clothes, push her around, etc). K tried to intervene, but B assured her it was all fine and that she could take care of herself.//Well, later that day, one of the children hugged her so hard that she tripped and fell into the wooden playhouse. She ended up being virtually incapacitated on the ground. Meaning K, the seventeen year old, had to call 911 and help B as best she could, all while having to wrangle over a dozen young children. B ended up being totally fine, and was released from the hospital the next day.//However, that event was extremely hard on K. She’s an extremely capable worker, but seeing someone she cared about hurt combined with having to call 911 and being virtually alone with the kids was hard. She asked me privately if I would be okay with instructing B and the kids to not get too physical with B. K has said she’s terrified of having another event like that, and I don’t blame her.//I talked with the kids and parents to make sure they understand that playing with K is different than playing with B, and they need to be more gentle. However, when I discussed this with B, she accused me of being ageist and said she could do everything she used to do just fine. Our coworkers are divided.

26,AITA for firing a female employee who posts provocative underwear pictures on her Instagram?,"I (m29) run a successful event planning business that I started with my ex wife about 7 years ago. When my ex wife and I divorced, she also divorced the business, and I then employed about 9 people to work for me. We now have offices and we have a tight group of employees who are almost like family to me now.//About 6 months ago one of my employees told me she was pregnant, and as a result was going to leave the business to be a full time stay at home mom. I had no issue with this, but it meant I had to find a new employee to take her place. I interviewed a lot of people before finding Olivia, who I went on to employ.//Olivia has lots of experience and is absolutely fantastic at her job. The clients love her and she’s really in tune with what the clients needs and desires are. The nature of our work is to build a rapport with our clients, which sometimes means social media is added by clients.//For my other employees this has never been an issue. They post respectable pictures of their families or travelling, it’s never been a cause for concern. Olivia, on the other hand, thinks herself as a bit of an amateur underwear model, and posts these pictures on her Instagram in very provocative poses. Usually I wouldn’t have an issue with this, but I don’t want clients seeing them and immediately looking down on my business.//I have Olivia a warning about a month after she started working for me and told her to stop posting pictures like that as it was bad for the image of the company. She said okay and for a while she did, but then after a month she started posting them again, even more than she did before. When quarantine began we were extremely busy as a lot of clients were calling worried their events were going to be cancelled, and during this time Olivia was posting a provocative picture once every few days.//Out of pure stress I fired her and told her I didn’t want her to work for me anymore, and she said she was going to sue me for “discrimination” and claimed I was being sexist which I definitely wasn’t.

Lori came to work for us during WFH. No one got to know her other than the brief online introductions and things shared in the group chats. She was pretty funny in the group chats, but I noticed a trend.//Lori parrots everything you expect to see on Reddit pages, Tumblr, and FB. It's hard to explain, but stuff like ""Oatmeal raisin cookies are the reason I have trust issues"" and ""I don't trust people who don't like dogs"" and all that doggo pupper goo goo ga ga pibble wibble woo woo shit, even older, dated stuff like Epic Fail or But I am Le Tired? It's all she would say.//Once we transitioned to being back in the office, I figured hey, I'm excited to get to know this woman because she must be different IRL. She's actually worse because while you expect some of the things Redditors or other ""online people"" say when you're online, in person it's just... awkward.//For example, when we were chatting in the break room (distanced, of course), she was showing pictures of her dog to people and she kept saying ""I don't trust people who don't LOVE dogs. Look at my doggo! He's such a good little pupper!"" and people were looking at her like... uh, okay. She turned to someone else and asked about their pets and the girl said ""Oh, I have a cat, here's a pic-"" and Lori just repeated ""UGH, I just do NOT trust people who don't like dogs. Whoever said cats were the new dog is seriously disturbed.""//People started to avoid her. At one point she sat with me at lunch and talked about how she might look for a new job because the people at ours are ""weird"" and ""kind of mean.""//I said to her, ""Didn't you basically yell at Jenny because she has a cat? You went on some weird awkward rant about people who don't like dogs. You think that could be part of the issue?""//She got quiet and said ""Well there's something seriously disturbed about people who don't like dogs. It's not my fault. I don't make the rules.

28,AITA for not giving my pregnant employee maternity leave?,"Sorry this might be long but requires some explanation. Throwaway so ppl don't recognize me.//I own a small-ish business. Our employees are all full-time salaried employees and are paid once per month. We give everyone 30 days of PTO every year that can be used at any time, for any reason. It just has to be approved beforehand so that operations aren't disrupted. It never expires and accrues indefinitely at 2.5 days per month.//We also give everyone what we refer as ""hiatus"". This is just like PTO but is accrues more slowly. It's 60 days every 4 years - accrues at 1.25 days per month. However, employees cannot use this until they accrue at least 30 days. So they must wait 2 years at least between each hiatus.//So as long as someone doesn't take any unpaid time off, they could take a month off every year and then another 2 months off every 4 years. Hiatus and PTO can be combined into 3 full months off - if the employee chooses to do that. We do not offer maternity leave or any other type of leave. However, in practice, most people use hiatus as a form of maternity leave. We do allow employees to go into negative PTO for life and death situations if their balance is 0 - but there are limits to this.//We do all of this to keep things fair. I don't think that people should be punished for having a baby but I also don't think that people should have to endure more work and pickup the slack for their coworkers without getting anything in return. I think the system we have is extremely generous and fair.//One of our employees, ""Jen"" is accusing us of discrimination. She is unexpectedly pregnant and wants to take time off. She has used all of her time so far and wants to either go negative for a month or two, or be given additional PTO. My answer was ""no"" but I offered her a few months of unpaid time off.//She didn't take this well and is making some dramatic statements that are causing a bit of a disruption at the office. At this point it's becoming a problem. My partner is very sympathetic and wants to be accommodating but I'm sort of taking a hard line here. Especially since this hasn't ever been a problem before. AITA?//Edit: we are not bound by any government mandate to offer leave. Jen has been our employee for 4 years. We have 47 employees.//Edit 2: any employee is able to work from home as long as they work a minimum of 40 hours per week. As long as they meet their deadlines and attend all meetings, they can make their own schedules.//Edit 3: We offer short term and long term disability insurance but it's optional. Most people choose not to take advantage of these benefits because, while we cover a portion of the cost, it's still ""expensive"" depending on the options you select//Edit 4: Conclusion: most people expect the owners of businesses to subsidize their decision to have children. Equal benefits for all employees isn't equal at all because parents should get extra leave and special treatment as a standard. If someone decides not to have children, they need to be paid less.

I never felt uncomfortable among the guys and I know they are all decent people.//About a week ago we had one additional staff, another lady ""Amy""(21). As you may have guessed from the title now, Amy got mad when Tom attempted to hug her and when Tom realized that, he quickly apologized and mentioned that he thought she wouldn't mind because I didn't. Amy said something like this.//""Just because dirty sluts love getting touched by guys doesn't mean all women do!""//Obviously I took it as an insult, I haven't done anything to Amy and she straight up said that in front of all the guys. I was tired and I didn't want to start a fight so I pretended I didn't hear it, but Amy kept yelling at Tom as he apologized profusely with a few other guys trying to calm her down.//Later on Amy approached me and told me that she needed my help to report Tom for harassment, and she got Kat backing her up. Still tired and in a bad mood, I replied sarcastically ""Yeah, I shall report too, you for your foul language, and the guys will back me up because they heard what you called me.""//Amy got really upset at me because she assumed that all women should stand up to the men, but she's got nerve wanting my help reporting my friend after insulting me out of nowhere. Kat told us to sort it out before leaving because she feels that she is too busy for drama and Amy got angrier because now she has nobody to back her up, and she blames it on me.//Just to be clear, I am not reporting anybody, too tired for that shit.

Unfortunately, in spite of the pandemic, I've been on mandatory in person shifts for months now. When I started, I tried my best to gel with everyone and make friends but pretty much everyone rejected me. Called me names as I worked behind the desk from their little cliques. Ignored me when I approached them. Some even blatantly insulted me for my hair and weight when I didn't even bring it up. This was from everyone, even guys who I thought would be more accepting than the women were mean as fuck to me too.//There was one woman, J, who is about the same age as me, who was different though from everyone else. I really thought that this one woman who acted so kind and genuine towards me (and who I liked as more than just a friend back then) was my only ""friend"" there. I mean, she was inviting me to hang out with her alone after work. I bought her drinks, we talked and texted regularly after work for several months.//A few months into our friendship, I was added into a group chat where I saw she was shit talking me about secrets I confided in her - mainly insecurities about my height and my physical attributes such as my hair and weight. All these worries about my future. All my fears. I told them all to her and she exposed me really quite hard. That did hurt. It broke my heart actually. But from then on, I understood never to trust anybody at that division and ignored her when she approached me, and she figured out that I had caught on to her exposing what I told her privately to her friends. From then on, we never talked to each other outside of work matters.//I thought that would be that. I would avoid everyone outside of work matters. But nope. Very recently, J approached me soaked in tears after work. She told me that she missed my company and wanted me to be there for her after one of the people in her friend group ""treated her like trash"". I figured it was some drama with regards to her love life and told her that no, I don't want to and never want to speak to her. She persisted, again and again and again. Approaching me at work to start inane convos, texting me after it and so on.//It was getting irritating and I snapped at her one day to leave me alone, calling her a ""stupid-ass bitch"". I admit, a mean insult. But I just don't like her and I don't want to speak to her. She just bawled and left me alone for a bit. But she started up harassing me in person and from text again, and I've had to talk to HR to stop her harassment. J was placed in a separate part of our division and sent me an angry stream of texts lambasting me as a ""prick"".

38,"AITA for ""embarrassing"" my colleague by laughing at his socks?","Hi, first time here, please be gentle!!.//So I, 28F am an employee working for a large company with several departments. There's this new guy that I see often at the reception from another department. He's good looking, wears nice suits, but his socks are just...they look weird. They're colorful and have patterns and animals and totally don't match what his wearing. Like they really stand out and you can't help but notice them.//He's been here for 2 months and has been basically wearing those unmatching socks religiously. Some of my colleagues laughed at him but they don't know him and rarely see him so no harm in that.//Last week, I was in a meeting with him and other employees from different departments. I sat at the corner but still couldn't help staring at his socks and trying to contain my laughter. He noticed but didn't say anything til he caught me looking at them again. That's when he sort of snapped and said ""you've been looking at my feet and laughing, is there a problem?"" . I finally just let out a laugh and said ""I'm sorry but it's just these penguin socks"" everyone stared at them then laughed. He looked around then immedietly went back to the project. Let me just say that it got awkward for everyone til the meeting ended.//He waited for me outside the office then pulled me aside and said that those socks I was laughing at had a huge value to him because, his late wife made them before her passing and he's been wearing them for a year now. I was stunned I said I was sorry for his loss and I was kidding...though I was kinda not because, I really thought those socks looked stupid and unmatching with his overall appearance. Plus, they make him look unprofessional and ruin his professional look. He said what was unprofessional is me going off topic and commenting and making fun of something so personal. He implied that he'd take this to HR someday soon which I thought was huge overreaction on his part. though, I don't really think he'll go through with his passive threat. He turned around and walked off.//I felt so terrible, I went back to my department and told my colleagues what happened. They told me he's egotistical and deserved the embarrassement because what did he expect when he decided to wear stuff like that and get attention, besides it wasn't like I made direct comments about the socks I just laughed quietly and did my best not to let it show and he brought it up....Gosh! I just....this entire situation made me nausous because he seemed like a nice guy but I think we got off the wrong foot sort of speak and maybe I was wrong, maybe he flew off the handle.//AITA though?",YTA,0.107,2300,F,28,M,,,higher,same,professional,no,verbally insulting or disrespecting,self advancement or interest,emotional distress,,Yes,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/tqxqt4/aita_for_embarrassing_my_colleague_by_laughing_at/?q=nta%20&type=comment
39,AITA for telling my colleague he only has his job because his uncle is the CEO?,"I’m early 20sF and last year started working at a major company. I entered this job through a scheme for disadvantaged young people. Despite this, the interview process was still incredibly tough and I’m proud to have made it this far.//When I’m not with my team I hang out with the other girls I’ve met and befriended through that scheme. The nephew of the CEO started his role at our department a little later and for whatever reason has been joining us girls for lunches etc. He tries VERY HARD to fit in and acts like he doesn’t come from a place of insane privilege. He will literally pretend to be humble and downplay his family’s wealth just to seem relatable I guess.//The others have been warming up to him but I’m honestly not buying his rather fake personality.//The other day I was sitting at the canteen with another coworker and he asked if he could join us. I didn’t want that but my coworker immediately said yes.//Well he was asking me lots of personal questions and about my journey to the company. I told him that the interview process was hard and mentally draining. He nodded and said that it’s tough getting into the place but that his interviews were “fine”. Even laughing and saying he came late to one because of a hungover.//This made me mad and I said “good for you”. He thanked me and said that things always work out when you just “chill out” and stop taking things so seriously. This is when I said that we both know he’s not nearly as competent as he believes and that he only got the job bc his uncle is literally the CEO.//My friend/coworker gasped and looked at me like I’m crazy. The nephew shrugged and said that I don’t seem to like him. I told him that this wasn’t a personal matter so likes and dislikes are irrelevant.//We didn’t argue but he got a little heated. And asking me what I want him to do. Then he said that I may view him as an over privileged asshole but I’m more or less the same (which makes no sense).//So I fully expected him to report me to HR but to my surprise he never did. In fact he started following me on my social media accounts and messaging me at work more frequently.//My coworker has relayed this incident to the other girls and the consensus is that I’m a major asshole.

A few of my coworkers joked that some of the clients we have right now don't give them anything to smile about.//So then I asked if any of them had ever been called harsh, and it was again all nos.//I told them that the boss had told me to smile more, and one of my coworkers sent me a picture of a girl pulling a silly face with a weird pinched smile and bug-out eyes saying ""well what BossMan says, he gets""//I thought that was hilarious and decided to actually do it.//Anyway, I started smiling more and more around my boss... But also a bit stupidly.

I said ""Uhh what face"" He said ""That one, just a second ago"" and my coworker said ""What, she was just smiling?

Look at this picture from last Friday"" and all of my coworkers backed him up saying that was just how I smile.//My boss was looking kinda incredulous so I clarified that if something makes me spontaneously laugh or grin, it probably looks a little more relaxed, but when I'm just putting on a smile to be polite or pose for a picture, I guess that's how I smile. And I was trying to be polite after he let me know I was coming off ""harsh"" in meetings.//Anyway, at my next one on one meeting, my boss said I didn't need to change my demeanor that much based on his comments, because honestly it was coming off disengenous and that would look worse in front of clients.//I just said ""Yeah, I guess I've never really been good at being super peppy without it looking fake.""//And as far as I know, that was the end of that.

We had it split into 3 weeks for the last three weeks of December. Week 1- trinket, week 2 - trinket, week 3- final gift, exchange and staff dinner.//Her first two gifts came the following week, which ruined her experience of looking for her gift and waiting for it to appear in the designated week, and she also felt that her final gift was below budget and not thought out (a wallet). As everyone was having their own experience, admittedly we didn’t notice how bad her’s was.//This year October we selected the names for secret Santa.

I’m not technically her “boss,” but as her senior, I basically act as a substitute for one.//I was a little suspicious of this girl (24F) because she seemed to have different experience than someone who would’ve wanted to apply for this role (she majored in UI/UX), but we had a lot in common and she seemed friendly. I used to work as a team lead for a game design studio and managed a bunch of younger employees who kind of saw me as a “team dad,” and she reminded me of the kids who used to work for me there. My last role was more competitive, but my wife is pregnant and I wanted to take an easier job to help her out with the pregnancy/baby.//I wanted to ease her into things, but apparently she had some training scheduled for UI/UX person during her “down time.” We don’t have “down time” here. I saw she had a meeting on her calendar with him for after work hours, so I told her she didn’t have my permission to do that. She said she had finished all the design work, but that’s only because I was shielding her from the harder work. I’m the one having to do the difficult projects and she’s not even a little thankful that I’m saving her from having to work weekends. I didn’t tell her do these tasks, but as an adult, it’s her job to take initiative and volunteer.//I’ve tried to look out for her best interests and be a friendly boss, but I also have to remind her that I’m in charge. During a meeting, when I was having a really horrific day (mostly because I was picking up work she should be doing + stress of my wife’s pregnancy), I snapped and called her a bitch.

50,AITA for telling a new colleague it’s her problem she lied about her qualifications and she can see for herself how to get by?,"I (26) make up the 3D modeling department of my company. The workload has gotten too much for me to handle on my own, so I asked for a second person. The company provided me with a girl (22) who graduated this year from the same college I went to. This college offers a 3 semester 3D course, of which only the first one is required, rest is optional, but she told me she’d taken all three. Her portfolio looks decent as well.//To keep this short, everything she produced was messed up and borderline unusable, causing me to spend a lot of time just fixing all her mistakes. She was also extremely slow, slower than I expected. This confused me, because with her supposed experience, the stuff I gave her to do shouldn’t have been such a struggle. On top of that I always said she could come to me if she gets stuck on something, but she never did.//I asked her why all her meshes are so bad and why she didn’t come to me for help, and she confessed. She’d only taken the required semester, her average was a D because the meshes were horrible and she hoped she could fake it for a while. I told her that is just not acceptable and that I have no use for her here. (FYI: Calling her meshes bad wasn't me just being rude. They can be objectively bad/messed up when it comes to functionality and usability. I said her meshes were ugly, then that would've been rude.)//She then told me that she was obviously desperate or she wouldn’t have taken a job she could barely do. She begged me to teach her to get her to where she’s supposed to be, but I was having none of it. I wanted someone to help with all the work I already had, not someone I’d have to teach almost from the ground up. If I teach her during working hours, I’ll be even more behind on my own work and I sure as hell don’t feel like using my free time for this. My central problem with this situation is that this is not something you get good at in a few weeks, especially in terms of efficiency and speed, which is why I was happy about her having taken all 3 semesters.//I told her she knew she was under qualified, so she can find out how to get up to speed by herself. Watch some tutorials, do some exercises at home. At work I’ll help her, but only to an extent, or else I could just do it myself in the first place. But when the boss asks me why I’m now slower than before, I won’t lie.

51,AITA for nearly getting my colleague fired and then refusing to help him?,"So I am 26, have been in my company for 3 years, I am in sales and the colleague in this case let's call him J is in customer support.//Everything was going good but problems started around last year J started asking money from saying he was going through financial trouble, he had become a good friend and since I was making significantly higher than him (which he knew) so I gave him the money he was asking. That's when it started, first it were small amounts then it gradually increased, I too kept giving because he returned the amount he borrowed on time as soon as we got our salary. Around 4 months back I had to buy a new laptop, phone, earbuds all together since everything I owned had become 4-5 yrs old I wanted to spend and enjoy. Due to this I did not have a lot of spare cash that month and did not want break my savings so I said No to J when he asked me to loan him a significant amt (around 35% of my monthly salary) he immediately pointed out that I earn more than him and am single and have my own house while he is married, has a small child and lives on rent and I should thus help him out.//He said I am the only colleague who considers his friend and he cannot ask anyone else for the same. He failed to return the money on time the first time since he started borrowing from me, 1 more month passed theresfter too. I did not pester him, he borrowed 2 more times without paying anything back and 2 weeks ago I and a few other colleagues were having coffee break and were planning a small trip on the weekend to celebrate and relax after a hectic month. One colleague said he would not be able to come, on digging we knew he was short on cash since he loaned J some money and I felt so betrayed that I blurted out that J took a loan from me too, this opened the flood gates and it turns out J has taken loan from nearly half of the office. This word got to HR dept soon and J had a rough meeting with HR where he was told tht while the company cannot force him to pay up to us and other members who loaned to him, he would be fired if this goes on to not frthr spoil the cmpny envrnmnt.//He immediately came to me when we were leaving the office at day end and first accused me of telling others that he borrowed from me and then demanded another loan so he could pay up to colleagues whose payments were pending since quite some time so he does not lose his job.I made a pretty good incentive last moth and had a lot of spare cash in my account but I told him no and that I feel exploited by him and it is not my fault he earns less then me or cannot manage his finances better.

54,AITA for asking my coworker if she deliberately wears clothes that show her cleavage?,"We (the company) had a new employee ""Christina"" working in our section and she's a nice lady in her late 30s. She's married with kids. We had several conversations before. We work close by and one time she was sitting and moved to the side and her already showing cleavage got clearer. The office got awkward and the guys there looked down. it was obviously something minor but it kept happening. I had a couple of our male coworkers complain to me about Christina's cleavage (I'm more of a tomboy woman so the men feel comfortable enough around me) they were saying that having to be forced to encouter a similar situation to the one I mention makes them uncomfortable. I couldn't help but notice that all the clothes, tops specifically that Christina wears are designed to show cleavage. I brought it up to her the next day and casually pointed out how her cleavage was showing. She said nothing, just noded at me. I went ahead and asked if she deliberately wears clothes that show her cleavage. She looked offended and asked if there was a problem. I flatout said that it felt weird to me if this was the case and that it was kind of weird also that a married woman is okay with her cleavage showing at a professional workplace with male co workers around. She got upset and asked how it was any of my business what she chooses to wear. respectfully, I told her she could wear whatever she want but some employees just don't feel comfortable having been exposed to this kind of stuff at work. She told me that it was none of my business and that those who have an issue with her clothes should stop being cowerds hiding behind me and come talk to her face to face. We had an argument and some of my female coworkers agreed with me though said that I could've phrased this better. Christina started avoiding half of us which seemed unprofessional because part of our job is to interact but she chooses to stay away. I tried talking to her and another argument started with her saying she'd take this to the administrators if ""I keep it up"" but I was really just trying to talk things out.//AITA for what I said to her?",YTA,0.265,3200,F,,F,39,,higher,same,professional,no,verbally insulting or disrespecting,conforming to norms,strained relationships,,No,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/xlv0f4/aita_for_asking_my_coworker_if_she_deliberately/?q=nta&type=comment

Because of this I get to hang out with my wife and our dog for most of the day. I normally take a 5-10 minute break around 4 or 5 times throughout the day so I can play with my dog. When I do that if I get a work message I just let people know I'll be a couple minutes and then I'll get back to them. I've been doing that almost every day for the past couple years and it hasn't been an issue until recently.//My coworker Mark occasionally asks for files or needs me to review something and if he reaches out during our playtime I tell him the same thing as everyone else. However he's started to complain that I am doing this.//The most recent one was he asked me to review some work for a project that he claimed was urgent and needed it done immediately. However my review is the third to last step for the project and the final two steps are also quick to do. The project also did not need to be completed until the 20th. I told him that I was in the middle of fetch but I would review and sign off on it in 30 minutes. He then pushed and said it was an emergency and it needed to be done now.

56,AITA for recommending my coworker seek therapy after she blew up at work?,"I work 2 jobs. One is in a distribution facility, and where this took place. The coworker is this really pretty 20 or 21 year old, who is always hit on by other coworkers, and treated a certain way as such. Despite her looks and attention for it, she’s a always been a sweet, likeable, soft spoken person. Thats not me having a crush, Im an engaged 31 year old man. Thats just been the truth, which is what made her explosion all the more shocking. For privacy, Ill call her Maria. So Maria has been quieter than usual the past few days, but otherwise been acting fine. So I already suspected something could be wrong.//However 2 days ago, this guy had been rushing to a dock with a handjack and accidentally bumped her with it, and said “excuse me!” in this rough tone. What made things strange was what she said in her reaction. She BLEW UP, uncharacteristic enough, but she shouted “IM TIRED OF FUCKING MEN ACTING LIKE YOU CAN TREAT ME LIKE SHIT! IM THE PRETTIEST FUCKING THING ALIVE! WHY THE FUCK DO YOU THINK YOU CAN TREAT ME LIKE THIS?” and basically stuff along those lines. It was extremely weird because no one ever heard her talk like this so most people were quietly working while she and him went back and forth. Then she started crying and walked off.//Instead of being put off by what she said, I thought maybe it was some mental breakdown, because shes not a conceited girl at all. So yesterday, a day after the incident and after both parties spoke to management, I pulled her aside to talk to her and tell her Im not necessarily the best person to understand whatever it is shes going through, but I have a therapist she can call. This was out of genuine concern. She seemed appreciative when I spoke to her and even thanked me, but I guess somehow she didnt take it as well as I thought because she went around crying to coworkers and a supervisor that I was being condescending, making fun of her and starting more drama. So then I got called to the office with Maria and two supervisors and it was my word vs hers. They took hers.//The problem is that people think I was doing it to be an instigator, and Im in trouble for it. This is easy for ppl to believe bc Ive always been the “funny” guy, but I can sometimes have a hot temper too. Thats just my personality. Humor has always been a coping mechanism. But I was not joking with her. Still, today, I ended up in a heated argument with a different coworker (Bree) about how I should’ve just stayed in my place and that ended in me calling her out of her name, and saying derogatory things, and me getting written up for both incidents, which I know that part was out of line but she wasnt minding her business either. So now the attention shifted from the initial incident to me vs Bree and Maria and Bree is trying to build a case against me saying she felt threatened.//Anyway, WITA for giving the therapist recommendation, despite me doing it out of pure concern, or should I have actually just stayed out of it?",YTA,0.105,70,M,31,F,20,,,same,labor,no,telling the truth,helping others,emotional distress,,Yes,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14d1iim/aita_for_recommending_my_coworker_seek_therapy/?q=nta&type=comment

She said the cake is vegan and she made it specifically so i could eat it, but knowing her very loose definition of vegan i asked a few questions about the ingredients and she didnt check any of them for milk or eggs, so I thanked her again but refused the slice. She made a big scene out of it, she started crying and saying she just wanted to do something nice for me and now i ruined her birthday.//Some colleagues told me not to mind her dramatics, but my boss told me that it was her birthday and i could have given her cooking the benefit of the doubt.

I always introduce myself with “I’m (my name) but you can call me (nickname).” None of my coworkers in the small business we work for have ever had a problem with this before, until Megan(25F), the niece of Jeff(50sM) one of the two owners, was hired. Jeff and Dave(50sM) co-own the business but Dave does the actual day to day running of the business. I introduced myself and my nickname as usual but she immediately said that “Bessie” (not the actual name) would be a better nickname because it comes from the beginning of my name and that she liked it better. I told her I really didn’t like that nickname and wouldn’t answer to it and asked her to please not call me Bessie but she insisted that it was so much prettier and that I just needed to get used to it.//For the next two months she tried to call me Bessie but I completely ignored her whenever she addressed me that way, even when I knew she really needed help with something. She would call my desk phone and say “hey Bessie” I would reply “you have the wrong number there’s no Bessie here” and hang up. She then tried to get some of the employees outside the office to start calling me Bessie, but I quickly shut that down. I usually finish my work early and help them with a lot of tedious little things that aren’t part of my job description and threaten to stop helping them unless they used my preferred nickname.//Friday she decided she was going to get me to respond to Bessie no matter what. We have an open office design but are at opposite ends. She started calling out Bessie in a singsong voice over and over again to try and annoy me enough to respond. Other coworkers got annoyed, most telling her to stop and one Lisa(43F) telling me to just let her call me Bessie already. I refused and she kept calling out Bessie louder and louder, until Dave barged in. He’d been on a conference call with an important client and could hear her yelling from his office down the hall. He told her to be quiet and that if she called me Bessie one more time, he’d write her up and dock her pay.//Later, Megan cornered me in the break room, called me an AH for getting her in trouble and called me Bessie again for good measure just as Dave was walking in to heat up his lunch. He gave her a stern look and said “I warned you.” Then he walked to HR to have her written up. Lisa is saying I’m the AH for never helping Megan and that, if I had been nicer or hadn’t fought her so hard on the nickname, she probably would have given up on it a while ago but because I made such a big deal out of it, it became a challenge.

It's like asking me if I'd like to become an actress or a doctor, neither appeal to me. However, T didn't see it that way, and said ""what, do you think you're better than me?"" I said no, of course not, I just wouldn't consider doing sex work as a career.//T took great offense, saying that if I'm happy earning peanuts working my life away for a boss just for ""dignity"" then that's on me, and I mustn't judge her for wanting to make a better future for herself, that she's not ashamed of what she is doing. She also said ""when your children ask you why they were poor their whole lives you can tell them it's because you had too much dignity to provide for them more.""//(I have two children, and I am fully able to provide for them; this pissed me off). She got up and went back to her desk. At this point one of my other colleagues (in a much higher, managerial position) had overheard her and asked me what had happened, so I told her.

I don’t talk about going on diets. I don’t judge other people’s food choices. I don’t really care about what you eat.//About 6 months ago, a coworker named “Diane” (40F) transferred to our office (we are “essential” so no work from home). She’s overweight and has constantly made remarks about my food choices. If I eat a salad, she’ll talk about how I have an eating disorder and promote toxic diet culture. She’ll say my body is ‘unnatural’ and ‘real women’ have curves. One time she even tried to make a case that the reason I’m still single is because men don’t find my skinny body attractive. Sometimes, though, she’ll do a complete 180. She’ll make remarks about how it ‘must be nice’ to be young with a metabolism like mine, or to have genetics that allow me to eat whatever I want without gaining an ounce.

61,"AITA for calling my coworker a ""nosy b*tch"" after she kept insisting to know my husband's salary?","My husband and I have, both 33, have been together since college. Over the years, he's had quite the career trajectory. He's a quant PM and makes like 10x what I make (and I make a good salary haha!). As we've grown wealthier, I've learned that people become nosier. Friends, acquaintances, relatives, you name it. In the beginning I would entertain the nosy questions, but since I turned 30, I've adopted a ""take no shit"" attitude. When people ask me how much he makes, I no longer say anything. I've learned the hard way that giving an exact number can have bad consequences.//My co-worker, 25, is new and she already has quite the reputation. Very chatty, catty, gossipy, you get the gist. You can just tell she craves wealth and status. She wears a bunch of flashy designer items and is always asking the ladies around the office which of the men are single.//Last Friday, our office hosted an afternoon happy hour. She approached me and asked how me and my husband's recent vacation to Europe went. I told her it went well and briefly summarized what we did. Then the conversation went something like this://Her: ""So what does your husband do?""//Me: ""He works in finance.""//Her: ""Oh wow, he must make a ton then to be taking you on all these lavish vacations! I hope you don't mind me asking, but how much does he make in a year??""//Me: ""Yes, we're very lucky that he makes a good salary."" Polite smile//Her: ""Oh c'monnn I won't tell anyone. How much does he rake in a year? Millions??""//Me: Awkward chuckle ""I'd rather not say, but it's up there!""//Her: ""What, he doesn't allow you to give an exact number or something??""//Me: Visibly annoyed ""No, I just prefer not to say.""//Her: Laughs in my face ""You'd think the stuck-up one would be the one with money, not the one without!""//Me: ""You should learn how to take 'no' for an answer and when to quit being a nosy bitch. It's a valuable lesson.""//Then I smiled at her and walked away.

66,AITA- Am I the asshole for making a coworker upset when I corrected her that we were just “coworkers” and not “friends”?,"Kind of a weird post but it just happened so I want to know if I’m the asshole. I just left a job that I had for over 2 years. During that time I had come to like many of my coworkers but I didn’t consider them to be friends as, in my opinion, friends are people who you hang out with and are able to text/ call out of the blue. I understand that my opinion of “friend” may not be the universal definition of friend but I have used this definition in my life and I consider people who fit the above description friends. All others are coworkers and colleagues. So if I don’t hang out or text you about non work related things then I am not your friend.//On my last day at work, a former coworker of my mine kept saying they would miss me and kept referring to me as their friend. I reminded them that while I enjoy their company at work, I don’t consider us to be friends. They were confused as they thought we were. I reminded them that every time I asked them to hang out outside of work, they would say no and would give reasons that ranged from understandable to one’s that were, well obvious that they didn’t want to hang out with me. I soon realized that maybe we weren’t going to be friends and that I had a coworker that was a colleague who I could talk to during work hours. I let them know that I only consider people my friend if I hang out with them outside of work. They tried to laugh it off as if I was not being serious. I told them I was serious and that I would consider them a coworker. They got upset and said that friends come in all different varieties and that we were friends because we had conversations at work. I politely informed them, that while they might see that as a friendship, I did not. I saw us as coworkers.//My coworker got quiet and didn’t continue the conversation. They then called me an asshole for making them upset. I was confused as it was a cordial conversation. Am I the asshole for making my coworker upset that I didn’t consider them a friend?//Edit: I forget that sometimes I don’t write out what I’m thinking. Just for clarification, the reason I said I did not see us a friends was because this person would go out and hang out with other people from the office and would tell me about it during lunch. Whenever I would ask to hang out it would always be a polite, no thank you. And that is fine. That would make us just coworkers. Maybe I am being petty.

However, things started getting weird about three months into working with him. Bob would make suggestive comments, jokes, and be overly flirty, which made me uncomfortable. He also became more touchy and would hovering and stare at me unnecessarily.//After a six-week break for school exams and extracurricular activities, I returned to work. Bob's behavior became worse and more frequent. Bob even took a shift with me on a day he never works and during a time he us usually doesn’t work. While I was doing dishes alone in the back, Bob was being annoying and asked me to take out the trash for him when it was his job to do so I got annoyed and told him off, reminding him that it was his job. He then started spraying water on me with a hose, saying “bad girl” I somehow managed to keep my cool and asked him to give the hose back so I could continue cleaning.//At that point, I was fed up and frustrated, so I waited until my General Manager (GM) came to the back.

My GM immediately intervened and told Bob to stop and my GM told me to immediately tell him if Bob continues. After that, Bob acted coldly towards me, and the rest of the staff seemed unresponsive for the rest of the shift.//Important Notes: I didn't explicitly tell Bob that I was uncomfortable, but I gave him hints through body language, tone of voice, and uninterested responses.

I usually hate using that term as shit comes up when you have kids. But she uses this as to why she can never come in on time, why she needs to leave early, why she’s always so preoccupied with her phone, why she can’t focus on what she’s doing so then she screws up and we have to fix her mistakes, etc. Her kid is 9 years old, in school all day (not even doing virtual learning, but in school). He’s a neurotypical kid, with no health issues. I get worrying about him, but like I said, about 80% of us have kids. We all still show up and do our job.

I also went to HR and they did diddly squat except have a meeting telling us we all need to pull our weight. Nothing changed.//The other day, she screwed up again. She was on her phone like she is most of the day and wasn’t giving it her all. It was a huge mistake that nearly cost us a client and it’s one that she’s made several times before. I admit, I wasn’t nice with her about this. I didn’t yell, but my tone was clipped and I told her that she needs to put the damn phone away and actually pay attention to what she’s doing. She got in a tizzy, saying that she was texting her husband about their son and she didn’t mean to, she’s sorry, etc. I said it wasn’t okay and she needs to just focus. She then tried saying “I have a kid, my mind is in two places”. I told her “I have 3 kids, that all go to different schools. I am here every morning on time, I stay until it’s time to go. I may have to take a call for my kids occasionally, I get you think about kids all the time, but I also manage to do my job. This excuse just doesn’t fly anymore. Do your damn job.” She quickly went about fixing her mistake and I walked away.//She didn’t go to HR or our boss over it, but someone else who overheard it did. I was severely reprimanded for this, saying that it’s not my job to have that talk with her. I said maybe not, but the people who’s job it was, weren’t doing anything. I didn’t get a formal write up, but things are tense.//Some of my co-workers think I did the right thing, others think I should’ve documented it with HR and let it go. I’m torn.

75,"AITA for telling my boss that my co-worker wasn't actually sick, but was just taking a ""mental health day""?","I work for a medium sized company. My job position is quite busy and there is a lot to get through every day, but we make it work. I have been there for three years.//In April we hired a new person to the department. She seems to be capable enough, although I have noticed from April that she has taken about a dozen sick days on top of her paid vacation which she took this summer. At first I figured it was no big deal, as people get sick and I didn't know what she was going through, but over time I began to notice a pattern. She almost always takes Monday off, usually when we are going to be slammed with a whole bunch of work. She comes in on Tuesday looking unwell in the morning, but by lunch time she has made a miracle recovery. The other times she took Friday off, which usually aren't as busy as Mondays.//On Monday morning I got to work, and as is often the case, she had called in saying she had a fever. This Monday was going to be particularly brutal because it was the end of the quarter and we could have really used her help. I worked for twelve hours and we barely finished our work inside of the department, and when I got to my car that evening I noticed she had texted me in the morning://Hey! I'm going to take a mental health day today. Do you mind doing [task that takes between 30 minutes and an hour] for me? Thanks!//I was just disgusted at this point because of all of the late days I had to work, she was at the center of so many of them. Maybe she was sick before, but I frankly didn't believe it any more and figured she was just taking more ""mental health days.""//I told my boss what she texted me and he responded that he'd handle it in the morning. Well, first thing the next morning, she comes in looking on the verge of death as is her usual act, and he calls her into his office. Apparently he told her that he knew about her mental health days and that he was fed up with her playing hooky because she knew we were going to be busy.//After that she gave up the sick act and began loudly complaining about me to everyone in the office. At lunch time she was waiting for me at the door to the cafeteria and confronted me about how shitty what I did was, so I simply responded that she shouldn't pass her work onto other people because she was too lazy to come in. She got visibly furious and embarrassingly yelled ""MENTAL. HEALTH. DAY."" in front of everyone at me, then went back upstairs.//I don't know what people think about this because nobody really wants to step in the crap that's in the middle of our office, but I'm getting a lot of sideways looks.

Recently our baker has been making the bagels very soft, and they have been getting stuck in the slicer. We have a pusher to deal with this, but most of my coworkers and even my manager, just pushes more bagels through (and it pushes the stuck ones out).//On Wednesday we had an accident with the slicer. My coworker reached too far in and sliced the top of her finger. It was barely holding on. She had to go to the hospital, and the slicer had to be taken apart and disinfected. All of my coworkers were buzzing about the accident. I hung out at the counter with the manager, who was pissed about having to take the slicer apart, and having to report the injury.//I have seen several of my coworkers smoke joints together in the morning before coming into work. I think that this is extremely unprofessional, but I’ve never made any comments about it. I keep to myself. This time felt different, so I let my manager know that she and several other workers smoke before shifts. It could be why she got hurt.

Their response was basically that I was seen as ""more of a do-er"" and that my co-worker had mentioned being interested in management at a review and that was that. If anything that made me even angrier. I explained that I was very disappointed in the decision and even more disappointed in how it was handled and that this person being my manager was not something I was willing to accept and that if they were placed in that position, I would be handing in my resignation.

More than 90% of our students’ families are multi-millionaires.

Then they tell the donors “Our employees care soooo much about the school that 100% of them donate to our general fund.”//This means that they put a lot of pressure on us to donate any amount of money, but they make it clear the amount does not matter. Even $1 is enough for them to advertise 100% participation. It is heavily implied that if anyone doesn’t participate it hurts the whole fundraising campaign.//The whole thing rubs me the wrong way.

So I guess from there the video spread like wildfire and the girl eventually found out and apparently had a breakdown and sobbed at work.//Tl;Dr- Found a porn video of a girl from work, told a friend, he told someone else and then it spread. Girl ended up breaking down and crying at work.",YTA,0.000,129,M,,F,,,,same,professional,no,verbally insulting or disrespecting,self advancement or interest,emotional distress,,No,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ahjjk7/aita_for_sharing_a_pornographic_video_of_a_female/
104,AITA for telling my coworker to put his phone away?,"Every morning at work before we open, my manager(40sF) will have a meeting with all of the employees to give us a rundown for the day and update us on things as needed. I (24F) am a manager on duty and have been working there for about 2 years.//One morning, when she was talking during the meeting, I noticed one of our employees texting nonstop on his phone. He (30sM) was sitting behind a cubicle wall out of sight from my manager, so I don’t think she noticed him being on his phone the entire time. It seemed that he was not listening to what she was saying at all, and not once did he put his phone down.//After a few more minutes of this, when there was a slight pause in the meeting, I asked him to please put away his phone while the manager is talking. He did put his phone down, and my manager rolled her eyes at me but kept talking.//A few days later, the manager came up to me, saying she needed to talk to me about something. I said okay, and she brought up this situation and how I was wrong and shouldn’t have told the employee to put his phone away. She said what I did was hurting my relationships with the employees (more context in a second) and that I should have left the situation for her to take care of. I explained that I felt that it was disrespectful towards her that an employee was texting/on their phone while she was talking during the meeting, and she said that it didn’t matter and wasn’t my problem. I was extremely hurt by this, but said okay.",YTA,0.095,36,F,24,F,40,,,inferior,professional,no,making or declining requests,exercising authority,strained relationships,,No,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/138sljx/aita_for_telling_my_coworker_to_put_his_phone_away/?q=yta&type=comment
105,AITA for chatting in the office and having a loud voice?,"I’ve been having some trouble at my current job, it’s my first office job since being in retail and studying at uni, it’s a big adjustment in a completely new sector. I feel the culture there is super old fashioned, it’s governed by all old white men and some of the rules are ridiculous. Things like women aren’t allowed to wear shorts but men are? Anyway, I was pulled up by my manager for not being good enough at the job and slacking by going on my phone and chatting too much. I thought fair enough I will take that; so I’ve cracked on with my work and I’m getting everything done on time and to a good standard.//Today I was getting on with my work while talking to a colleague having light chat to pass the time, I wasn’t turned facing this colleague, I was typing away and sound was coming out of my mouth..so one of the managers tells us to quieten down as he couldn’t hear his teams meeting. We did exactly that and stayed quiet, later on I get a call from my manager and she says she’s received an email from him saying how frustrated he is with hearing my voice and me talking (even though I’m doing my work). I’m naturally a chatty bubbly person and I just have the urge to vocalise my feelings and say things. My manager also went onto say how the big boss is also sick of hearing me complain and say I don’t understand things and that I’m confused…she pulled me up on speaking about subjects such as “lunch” and “coffee” and deemed them inappropriate while my male colleagues talk about football for hours and they haven’t had such comments said to them.//I feel this is an attack on me as a person and my core being. She said the others don’t get pulled up because my voice is the loudest” I can’t help how I sound..I’ve struggled with it my whole life. I have good intentions, I want to do my work and have a good relationship with my colleagues.
