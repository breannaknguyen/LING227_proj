"My boyfriend (29 m) and I (26 f) are currently long-distance. We take turns visiting each other. He came to see me after almost two months of not seeing each other. We finally were to make plans. I requested to have five days off which was approved from my job. I’ve worked there for six years. I’m a security guard at a department store.//It was after my shift, and I was heading out quickly. I had to pick my bf up from the airport. I clocked out, and while I was saying bye to everyone. My new boss of 2 weeks stopped me, and he asked if I could cover a shift. Since one of my co-workers called in sick. We’re short-staffed, and he needs me to stay for a couple hours more. I had a 10-hour shift. I was exhausted.//I responded no. I’m sorry, but I’m unable to do that, and I can’t stay late. I have covered shifts before in the past. I don’t mind, but I had somewhere to be. I mentioned I was picking up someone at the airport. He told me they could take an Uber. My boyfriend wouldn’t be happy with me if I did to him. Also he has no key to my apartment.//No one else wanted to stay, and I was the third person he asked to that said no. I said sorry, I can’t just tonight, another time.//He called me a lousy worker, and I’m not a team player. I said, guess I’m not a team player and I walked passed him. I called out. I’ll see him in five days. While driving to the airport, I kept getting calls and texts from him; it got so bad that I had to pull over to turn off my phone. My boss wanted me to come back to work.//I had to turn on my phone, so my boyfriend could contact me. My phone was flooded with text messages. Ding after ding I think I got close to 15 texts. I blocked his number.//I was so happy to see my bf. I was getting emails from my boss constantly when I was supposed to be my time off. I didn’t respond to and I rarely take vacation. One, he was asking me stuff that I didn’t know the answer to. Second, even if I did, I’m not telling him. I don’t know; I was starting to get petty.//I still had fun with my boyfriend. When I went to work, my boss called me into his office. He blew up at me for being unprofessional, and he’s still new to this job. I should’ve helped or at least replied to the emails. I responded other people could’ve helped him. It’s not my responsibility when it’s my vacation time. I got my first write-up ever.//Is this something I’m missing? Did I do something inherently wrong here? I’m actually considering to report him. He is still new to his job. Am I the asshole?//Edit: I’m Canadian. I live in BC.//Update: I just sent an email to my HR with all the emails texts call logs. And any other evidence I have. My job isn’t like on call.So I don’t understand why he was bothering me he is my age roughly. On a happier note me and my boyfriend are planning to move in together//Edit: I’m a security guard at a departmental store. I like my job. HR Is setting a meeting up for tomorrow with me and my boss. My boss Tried asking me out in his first week of working But I told him down (nicely).//Edit: Thank you for everyone’s support. When I posted this I thought I was being a little dramatic. I’m glad I’m not the crazy one. I decided that I’m gonna look for a new job. I still wanna do security work but I’m just gonna move on. Don’t worry I’m still going to complain about my boss And report him.//Final update. My boss was fired.",NTA,NTA,NTA
"I work as an event coordinator at an establishment I'd rather not name. My job is to sell/ create events for kids birthday parties, adult events, et.//Our boss used to allow all the overtime we wanted. But a few weeks ago, she sent us a text saying, ""Moving forward. No one is permitted to work outside of their scheduled times. We are no longer able to have over time.""//Most of our sells are done over the phone, but sometimes people will come in-person to tour the facility and to discuss the event they want to have. These conversations can take anywhere between 30 minutes all the way up to an hour sometimes.//Sometimes, a customer will come in to book an event when I'm clocking out. But even if we were allowed over time, I have a life outside of work. I cannot stay 30 minutes late at a moment's notice.//Tonight, it was just my boss and I in the office and it was 6:59pm (I get off at 7pm) when a family walks in to book a birthday party. So I politely asked the family to take a seat and to wait one moment. Then I went into my boss's office to ask her if she would like to see the family or if she would rather I take their info and call them tomorrow morning.//She got mad and said she couldn't believe I've been, ""turning people away"" instead of staying late to help them. I apologized and told her I know we aren't allowed to work overtime any longer and I told her that I couldn't stay late tonight because I had plans (that was a lie).//So she started helping them (I heard her tell them the office was closed though) and I clocked out and got in my car.//Soon after I left, she calls me to complain about what I did. I politely explain to her that I schedule my personal life around the schedule she gives us and I cannot stay late at a moment's notice because I have things going on outside of work. I also referenced the fact that she told us we are no longer allowed to go over 40 hours.//She said we'll have to change my schedule around so that I can stay late when I need to. I asked her if she was going to cut my hours (something she just did to my co-worker because she was mad at him) but she said she'll have to make my shifts different times. I told her that even if I get off at 5pm, if I have to be somewhere after work, I wont be able to stay late.//She said she has to do what's best for the company and that we'll have to have a conversation tomorrow. So I took a screenshot of the text she sent us telling us that overtime is no longer allowed.//I have never been late for work and I never leave early. During our last 2 meetings she told me that I've been doing a great job. So I think it's more than reasonable that I leave when my shift is over. Those are the hours we agreed to, so those are the hours I'm prepared for.//TLDR: My boss is pissed at me for not staying late today after I told her I had plans and she told us we aren't allowed to have overtime.",NTA,NTA,NTA
"So I'm an engineer and I'm working on a team with 7 decently chill guys and one guy with anger issues. Like he can't just have a respectful disagreement, he'll raise his voice and yell and get up close to your face. I hate it.//So I started by just complaining to my boss about it. And he brushed it under the rug saying he is just like that. And if I thought he was bad now I should of seen him 10 years ago before he ""mellowed out""//It makes me wonder what he was like 10 years ago because he sure ain't mellow now.//It's also a small enough company that there's no HR, only the corporate management. Which didn't help.//So I took a different approach. I stopped calling him ""angry"", or calling what he was doing ""arguing"" or ""yelling"". I just swapped in the words ""emotional"" or ""throwing a tantrum"" or ""having a fit""//I was kinda hoping if I could shift his reputation from domineering (big man vibes) to emotional and tantrumming (weak sad baby vibes)//So I started just making subtle comments. Like if I had a meeting with him and he got a temper, I'd mention to the other people ""Wow, it's crazy how emotional Jay got. I dunno how he has the energy to throw a hissy fit at 9 am, I'm barely awake""//Or when my boss asked me to recap a meeting he missed, I told him ""Dan, Jack, and James had some really great feedback on my report for (this client). Jay kinda had trouble managing his emotions and had a temper tantrum again, but you know how he gets.""//Or when a coworker asked why he was yelling I'd say ""Honestly I don't even know, he was getting so emotional about it he wasn't speaking rationally.""//I tried to drop it in subtly and some of my coworkers started picking it up. I don't think consciously, just saying stuff like ""Oh, another of Jay's fits"" or something.//I got gutsy enough to even start saying to his face ""Hey, I can hardly understand what you're trying to explain when you're so emotional""//And again my coworkers started picking up on it and I even caught several of them telling him to get a hold of himself.//After a while, he started to get a reputation as emotional and irrational. Which I could tell pissed him off. But he stopped yelling at me as much.//Anyway, he slipped once this week and I just said ""I really can't talk to you when you're being this emotional"" and he blew up at me asking why I was always calling him that. I shrugged and said ""dude you look like you're on the verge of tears, go look in the mirror before you ask me"" and he got really angry I suggested he might start crying. (That was a kinda flippant comment, he was red faced angry not tearful angry, and I could tell.)//I feel like a bit of a dick for being petty and trying to gaslight this guy into thinking everyone around him sees him like a crybaby.

"One of my coworkers who I had thought was friendly but that was it (he is married) sent me some inappropriate texts at like 3 am on St. Patricks Day weekend.//Asking me to come over and ""have some fun"" and saying that he had been into me for a while and knew I felt the same. (I don't, I'm a lesbian but not out at work)//He also sent me a naked selfie that (luckily) cut off right before his dick but ... Dang it was close.//When I saw them, I was out with friends and was like ""What the fuck... Ok this is a Monday problem"". I have a really strict rule with myself that I don't do work, think about work, or answer messages about work outside of 9-5 M-F. I also don't use my personal phone for work stuff.

"Hi. A couple of weeks ago we had a new employee hired at the company. he's a good guy and a widower named ""James"" (36) and to my knowledge his late wife passed away 8 months ago. Me (f32) and the other coworkers got along well with him. However I noticed that he is still wearing his wedding band on his finger. It kind of confused me a bit and I couldn't help but bring it up with him while on lunch break//We talked and I pointed out that he was being misleading by still wearing his wedding band when he's a widower. He looked quite bothered by what I said but I tried to explain that I think that he was giving people the wrong idea or impression about his relationship status since he's technically single and on his own right now (don't want to sound cruel but I'm speaking from technical angle). James said that he didn't give it much thought (meaning he don't care what people think) and that even if he wasn't wearing his wedding band and some woman approached him he'd still turn them down since he's obviously not interested.//For some reason things got awkward and everyone stopped eating and just stared at James and me. I told him I don't know but that really really felt generally misleading of him as in making people think he is in a relationship (married) when he is not regardless of how he felt about being in a relationship. He got upset, called me rude, and said that I repeatedly disrespected his marriage and his late wife's memory with what I said then took his stuff and walked away. My co workers said regardless of who is right or wrong (though some said he overreacted) there was no reason for me to bring this up on the first place and cause a scene and make James upset with us like that now he's not speaking to me and others who sided with me.//AITA? Did I overstep or did he overreact?//This was just a conversation we were casually having with the other co workers and I didn't use any insensitive tones or anything but we had a discussion and it suddenly turned into an argument. I tried to let things calm down but the situation got out of my hand unexpectedly.",YTA,YTA,YTA
"Last week a new colleague ""Cathy"" (33f) started at my (25f) work place. She instantly stood out in the team, because she seems like someone who is very... loud and assertive? Two of my colleagues, me and Cathy were having coffee in the break room (we were the only ones in there and we were sitting far apart), when the subject of travel was brought up. My colleague said she wasn't booking trips anymore because it'll probably get cancelled because of covid anyway. Cathy, immediately cut in about how sad she is because she travels so often and she goes on these far ""exotic"" trips to Europe as her hobby. When I think exotic I think the Bahamas or something instead of Europe but. Cool.//Cathy then jokes about how all this ""no travel business"" is making her fear that she'll lose some of her foreign language skills. I asked what languages she spoke. She claimed to be fluent in 3 European languages, among which were French and Dutch. Cathy said she was ""at a native speaker level"" and went on about how people in Europe were always surprised when they found out she wasn't from there.//I was excited, because I never get to speak Dutch over here. I was raised in Belgium, which has three national languages: French and Dutch (which are my mother tongues and the most commonly spoken there) and German. It's quite common to be pretty fluent in at least two out of the three languages in Belgium, because you're required to learn them at school (along with English) from a young age. I told Cathy ""oh leuk, dan hebben we iets gemeenschappelijk!"" (""oh fun, we have something in common then!"")//She immediately pulled this sour face and asked me if that was supposed to be Dutch. I said yes. She laughed awkwardly and said she ""couldn't understand because I have a terrible accent and must not be that good at speaking it."" Now see, I don't have an accent. I speak Dutch more fluently than I speak English. I told Cathy that I grew up speaking Dutch and speak it to my family all the time.//She got miffed and asked what languages I speak and where I'm from. I told her I'm from Belgium, so I also speak French and I added ""which you just said you speak as well, cool! We can speak French instead!"" I acknowledge that I was a bit of a dick here, because by that point I knew she probably lied about speaking French as well. She then shoved her chair back and angrily got up, said ""whatever"" and stomped off. It was awkward. My other colleagues just kinda shrugged and said she shouldn't have lied.//However, she later approached me and told me I embarrassed her by acting ""superior"" about my European heritage. I told her there was no way for me to know she'd lied about speaking those languages. She rolled her eyes and told me I was immature. A colleague told me that Cathy had called me a ""little b-word who enjoys bullying new colleagues"" behind my back later. I don't think I was a bully at all, but I don't want this to turn into a huge thing. Do I just apologize to keep the peace? AITA?",NTA,YTA,NTA
"I work in fast food. I've had this job 6 years, and I've always struggled to be on time. A few months in, I was made a manager. There always needs to be a manager in the building, but at that location, it made no difference if I was late- there were always multiple managers there.//And then I was transferred to my current location. It's smaller, and has a lot less managers. If I was late, someone would be waiting for me to show up so they could leave. After about a week, I sat down with my manager, Eliza, and we made a deal. My schedule was changed so that all of my shifts started an hour earlier. So I had 9 hour shifts, instead of 8, and there was a guaranteed one hour overlap between me and the person before me. And it worked wonderfully. Even being regularly late, I still had the smoothest transitions because of that overlap, and nobody was inconvenienced. The manager before me would also sometimes be able to leave early, which everyone (in particular, Eliza, who was salaried) enjoyed. Eliza even tried to convince the others working my shift to do that as well, but they refused. So it's still an 8 hour shift, with only me working 9 hours.//2 months ago, Eliza got transferred. We got a new manager, John. I don't know how the transition goes, but I assumed that even if he was made aware of it, he would not be willing to continue my deal from before. I've had a second job now for 3 months, and easily worked through my lateness issues there (tardiness isn't punished there, but makes the job much more difficult- the work starts on time, whether you're there or not), and felt like I could do fine with that at my main job as well, as long as we could go back to the 8 hour shifts. But when we got our first schedule made by John, I was still given a longer shift, with an hour earlier start time. I honestly prefer it this way- mostly because it allows me to stress a lot less about when I get there. John seems to like it that way too- he regularly leaves early on my days. So I see no need to bring it up with him. But I'm being told by the other managers (and even some crew) that John complains constantly to them about my lateness.//Am I the asshole for not being on time until my manager addresses it with me?",YTA,YTA,YTA
"Background: I (26f) just started my first job after finishing my masters, and work in a dept with another colleague (27f, Thea) who joined the company 2 months before me. She is currently in graduate school, and I'm amazed at how she is very efficient and fast in her tasks.//I noticed that Thea is always assigned complicated tasks despite being new to the company, and I wanted to join the projects that she's in so I can learn from her. Initially, Thea was fine with it, and I learned that she is someone who will implement very strict timelines in order to get things done. I had trouble keeping up because I wasn't used to having such deadlines, but she would just tell me to be faster next time and move on.//Recently, she put up a huge whiteboard at her desk which detailed all her meetings and tasks for the month. I was very impressed with the set-up, and asked her what the tasks on her board meant. She became very irritated when I asked if there was room for one more teammate, and she finally snapped and said 'not everything with my name needs you involved.'//I was surprised at her hostility, but just thought she was having a bad day. But ever since then, she's been very distant and just generally difficult to work with. She wouldn't be as helpful as before when it came to retrieving documents that I need, implemented tougher deadlines, and would just avoid me by going home earlier.//I felt that she was creating an overly hostile work environment that was affecting my productivity, and felt like the right thing to do was to report her to HR. I did so, after collecting some evidence, and HR said that they would talk to her. Well, the talk didn't seem to go well because now our boss has told me to just stay out of her way, and removed me from all projects that involves her. Thea has even been moved to another section in the office, closer to our seniors, who I've heard been trying to placate her to stop her from leaving.//I'm conflicted as I don't want to ruin my workplace relationships.

The first day I saw them was actually on the day we celebrated my birthday at work. I cut the cake in multiple smalls servings so everybody can enjoy and C said ""I shouldn't, I'm watching my weight"".//The thing is, I am obese 300lbs for 5'8. I don't have a complex regarding my weight and I am healthy, but I try my best everyday to lose weight since I want to start a family. I do have multiples medical difficulties regarding losing weight, PCOS being the main one. And C, she is probably three times thinner than me. I brushed it off, thinking she just was just making an excuse for not wanting cake.//The week after, as I came in the office, I heard her saying ""but guys, I am morbidly obese"". Thinking it was a coincidence, I laughed and said ""If you are, what am I ?"" before getting to my desk. She continued talking about being ""fat"", despite everybody telling her to change the subject, even told her to calculate her BMI and stop if it doesn't say ""morbidly obese"". Which she did, but denied having a heathy weight despite the calculator saying so.//The day after, I came in early with a coworker R(28M). She sat next to him after greeting us. Before anybody asked or said anything, she quickly told him 'By the way, I'm starting intermittent fasting"". He asked why and then C explained that her doctor told her yesterday (even though she worked all day?) that ""she has PCOS and if she doesn't lose weight, she will become diabetic"".//I couldn't help but laughed. I know this is bullshit. She might have PCOS, but there is multiple steps before getting to this point. R tried to make her stop, but she continued, so I lost it and just told her to ""shut up about her weight"", since I was getting really annoyed. She didn't said a word to me all day after that.//It has been two days and I don't feel too good about it. R told me I am not the blame per se, but I could have been nicer.

"Ok so I’m not a very talkative person AT ALL. I hate small talk, I don’t like talking about myself and I’m not particularly interested in other people either. It seems like every workplace I go to people think I’m weird because I don’t socialize. I’m not rude or anything, I just don’t go out of my way to have conversations with people I’d rather listen to my music. The other day while I was on lunch break one of my coworkers just randomly asks me while I’m minding my own business “why are you always so quiet man? You never say nothing!”. and immediately I got so pissed off. Without thinking I responded “same reason why you’re so loud” and he was all like “yo man relax it was just a question”. Then I said “is there a problem or…?” and he said “alright never mind man I’ll leave you alone” and that was that.//I feel like I was unnecessarily rude here but it’s just I’m so sick of people asking me that question and making it sound like an accusation. It’s like being quiet is a bad thing to them or it means there’s something wrong with me. Like why even ask someone that? I know I could’ve just said something like “oh idk” or “it’s just the way I am” but why should I have to explain why I’m minding my own business? Still I took out my anger on this guy when it really wasn’t about him, it was the fact I’ve been asked that stupid question so many times that annoyed me.//If I am the asshole, should I apologize to him?

He constantly micromanages and refuses to accept any fault.//I hate when people sing happy birthday at a restaurant because I know anxiety is very common and no one really enjoys doing or receiving it so I always ask when people say they're celebrating a birthday if they'd like someone to sing. Sometimes they say yes other times they say no.//My boss completely ignored me when I said a young girl didn't want anyone to sing and tried to force me to do it anyway. I refused and when he asked why I lied and said I was a jehovahs witness because I knew they couldn't legally force me to go against ""my"" religion (I'm an atheist but that wouldn't have been good enough). He then got someone else to do it and when they were done I apologised privately to the girl, saying that I did what I could. She had this pained look and said it was fine and that she appreciated the effort.//After that I was off the hook for any birthday or Christmas celebrations (much to the annoyance of my boss).

That being said it's all commission based, I know a number of sales guys who have second jobs to make ends meet. I've always tried to be an operations friendly sales person. I know the reputation sales people have, and I try to not be that way. I stop by the office once or twice a month with beer and pizza for operations, I've given the kid who works on all my orders a 1k bonus more than a handful of times when I've closed big deals, I give small Christmas gifts to everyone that does anything for me in the office. Small things like that, and I never stress deadlines as long as we're within a week or two of meeting them, I really try to be the easiest person you can work with.//My mentor who made me the salesman I am today sometimes funnels sales through me since he's retired. The company knows, no one has an issue and I owe the guy my professional career so I do these deals for nothing. I do all the legwork, get nothing and pay taxes on the income. It's not much and I'm comfortable so it's not a big deal. I recently closed a sale for him that was a nightmare, I mean the worst customer I've ever dealt with.

Again I never mentioned this to anyone just closed the sale. My mentor made more than I've made from any deal on that deal, as always he offered me a cut but I told him there's no way I'd accept it and moved on. While operations don't see what we make on deals, the assumption is usually the bigger the sale the bigger the commission. That's not always the case but they don't know that. When I closed this sale the kid I work with was hinting that he expected a huge bonus from me for this sale. I laughed and told him sorry bud, nothing thing time, I made nothing on this sale.

I assumed he was just bummed, which was fine.//The next day I got a long email from him going on and on about how hard he works, and how he doesn't make a quarter of what I make a year, and if it wasn't for him I couldn't close a single sale.

"Edit for context and info: Yes, my assistant was given multiple warnings both verbally and official written warnings about her inappropriate comments specifically about pregnancy and to a lesser extent, babies and children. Moreover, I’m an employment and labor lawyer and the head of HR is also a lawyer so are careful to make sure everything is done properly. Regarding the eavesdropping matter, her desk is right outside my office so it is conceivable that she could overhear conversations that occur in my office. However, my office doors were shut and my husband and I were speaking very quietly. Hence, I think she intentionally eavesdropped on our conversation. Finally, I realize “unborn fetus” is not an improper term. I don’t like it as used by my assistant bc she uses it interchangeably with any inanimate object and often makes jokes about how an unborn fetus isn’t actually a real person. Thus, her use of that phrase with me was intentional.//I (39F) am pregnant with my first and am very excited by this. However my assistant, who is generally a nice person other than that this quirk, hates all things related to pregnancy, babies, and children.//I recently got in a minor car accident and had to go the hospital to make sure the baby was fine. When my husband dropped me off at my office after this incident, we discussed what we would ever do in a scenario where he would have to choose between me or the baby. I said to my husband that if it’s a choice between me or the baby, please pick the baby. Apparently my assistant eavesdropped or overheard our private conversation. After my husband left, my assistant kept saying she wanted me to understand my worth and that I, as a fully formed person, am clearly worth more than an unborn fetus.//I think probably the combination of having to try constantly to not acknowledge any aspect of my pregnancy around my assistant, her eavesdropping on very personal conversations with my husband, and finally, referring to the my future baby as an unborn fetus was just too much for me to take. Honestly, she’s actually a pretty good assistant other than this hang up she has about all things pregnancy, babies, and kids. But I couldn’t handle being around her anymore and had her terminated.

An hour before her shift was supposed to be over, she calls me back.//I ask her if she's ok, and she says she needed to ""take a mental health day and do some self-care"". I'm still pretty pissed at this point, but I'm trying to be understanding, as I know how important mental health can be. So I ask her why she didn't call me as soon as she knew she needed the day off. Her response: ""I didn't have enough spoons in my drawer for that."".//Frankly, IDK what that means. But it seems to me like she's saying she cannot be trusted to handle the responsibility of opening the store in the AM.//So I told her that she had two choices://Go back to her old position, with her old pay.//I fire her completely.//She's calling me all sorts of ""-ist"" now, and says I'm discriminating against her due to her poor mental health and her gender.//None of this would have been a problem if she simply took 2 minutes to call out. I would have got up and opened the store on time. But this no-call/no-show shit is not the way to run a successful business.//I think I might be the AH here, because I am taking away her promotion over something she really had no control over.//But at the same time, she really could have called me.//So, reddit, I leave it to you: Am I the asshole?",NTA,YTA,YTA
"My husband and I took a much needed vacation to the beach last week and the entire week before we left I sent emails arpund letting everyone know I'd be completely inaccessible for the week so to come and see me for any work materials needed, files etc. I gave everyone everything I knew or thought they'd need and left confident that everyone had prepared themselves, seeing as I'd given them 8 days to prepare.//When I returned I found chaos in the office. Apparently one of my colleagues had needed files for a particularly important client of ours and had not been able to find them in my office and I never responded to calls or emails, as I warned I wouldn't do. This coworker knew they'd be handling this client and had 8 days and 12 hours a day to ask me for all pertinent files and appears to have not.//In any case, I was blamed because the client is technically mine and I am supervisor of this coworker.//I contend that I am blameless because this coworker had 8 days to collect all their files like their other coworkers did and they neglected to do so. No one seems to care about that.//AITA here?",NTA,NTA,NTA
"I (M22) am a substitute teacher. In my district we're paid the legal minimum for the job. If you work more than 15 days at a school you get ""normal"" pay - I only ever get jobs that are exactly 15 days. A few days into my placement, I heard some teachers (both M30ish) in the lounge complaining that bus monitors only get paid $20 an hour, and laughing about how only an idiot would do a job for that little. I make $14.50. I jumped in and told them, they didn't know I was being paid that little.//My monthly grocery budget is $150. An entire paycheck has to go to rent alone, and then the majority of the rest goes to medical expenses (I am permanently disabled), other bills, and gas. I usually have less than $10 total for a few days before my next paycheck. I don't qualify for SNAP. My disabilities make most food pantry items inaccessible (I have anaphylaxis from nuts, honey, peppers, and more). For the past month, thanks to a prescription going up in price, I have been eating once every 24 hours to keep making rent, but for the last 8 months I've been food insecure. I usually cry on the way home because I pass by fast food and know I can't even get a hamburger. I'm almost always so hungry it hurts.//I admit I've got some resentment to my job for paying me so little while the school constantly complains that we don't have enough subs. I've had anger building up over the fact that I'm starving, and they only hire me for the maximum days before they have to pay me more.//Where I might be the asshole://I've started being open about the fact that I'm hungry at work. I never ask for food – just stuff like they'll ask if I can keep a student in the room over lunch, and I'll be chipper/my usual self and reply ""of course, I'll just be reading, I couldn't afford food today."" A teacher I don't know will ask what I packed for lunch and I'll say ""nothing, I can't afford that much food."" Stuff like that. It's always true. I'm careful to not exaggerate.//Recently I was in the library and the librarian asked if I had dinner plans. I said no, I have to skip eating today because I can't afford it. She looked at me weird and said while she won't judge me for being unable to eat, it's very unprofessional to talk about it at work where you're being paid. I told her if it's unprofessional for me to talk about starving it's just as unprofessional to pay me so little I starve. She went quiet and we didn't really talk for the rest of the day.//She got me thinking and I'll admit I don't know if I'm actually being an asshole. I know other staff aren't the ones who pay me so little. But I also feel like my struggle is invisible, and after full time teachers called anyone taking even $20 an hour an idiot, it's really been eating at me (ha).//TL;DR I'm being open about the fact that I'm food insecure at work, and don't feel bad for making the people paid more than me feel awkward. I was told it was unprofessional and snapped back.",NTA,YTA,NTA
"25M I work a mundane office job in middle corporate America and spent most days hating whatever decisions I made to get me to this point. One of the people I am closer with is “Ash” 24F. We are the only people under 30 in the office so that’s why we’ve gotten closer.//Yesterday, we had our “spring cleaning” day. This is where we were instructed to wear comfy clothes we can beat up in order to clean the office. We were instructed to wear jeans and a t shirt or whatever was comfortable and similar to that. No sweat pants though.//The short version is that Ash was called into our bosses office and spoken to about her outfit choice. Which was jeans and a cropped sweater. I guess they just told her that wearing a cropped sweater that went just above her navel was inappropriate work attire even in a situation like this. Boss gave her an old t shirt with the company logo to change into.//Ash spent the next 30 minutes yapping my fricking ear off about how it’s unfair, sexist, and embarrassing that she was spoken to about her outfit. She said she was wearing jeans, and wore a comfortable top that she could get dirty and that is exactly what boss said we should wear.//After growing tired of listening to her, I told her that i don’t feel bad for her and that she made a dumb decision. She accused me of being as “sexist” as our boss. I told her she’s in a corporate job, and she’s not 16 so frankly she should know better and that it doesn’t take a genius to know you should probably have shoulders to knees covered in a work setting.//I know I didn’t put it kindly, but she was also yapping for awhile and I just couldn’t understand how she didn’t see this coming. So am I THE ass opening?",NTA,YTA,YTA
"I (50f) am a director at an arts nonprofit and have one direct report (25f) underneath me. Our fiscal year starts in July, and she has taken 13 of her 15 vacation days already.//She recently requested an additional 7 days off to go on a trip in June. When I asked her about it, she said she would use her unused sick days as PTO.//As a company, we get 15 vacation days, 9 sick days, and 3 personal days. I told her that sick days are not to be used the same as PTO, they are only to be used when sick. She pushed back, saying employees should be able to use all of their allotted days off for any reason, otherwise she was being ‘punished’ for not being sick and not taking those sick days off throughout the year.//I ultimately decided to not pay her for her upcoming vacation, because I don’t want to start a new precedent for the whole company to use sick days and PTO interchangeably.//Here is where I’m wondering if I’m TAH. When I told her she would not be paid, she asked if she were to be sick for the same amount of time before the end of the year, would I pay her then? I answered yes, because if she is genuinely sick, we owe her that time off. Sick days do not roll over at the end of the year, but I held firm that sick days are only to be used when genuinely sick.//So Reddit, AITA for not letting my employee use unused sick days as PTO?",NTA,NTA,NTA
"OK title sounds bad but hear me out. So for context I (26f) have been working at a corporate job for about a year, it's great, pays really well and I get along with pretty much everyone. However, there's this manager at work, let's call her Leanne (~40f) and most of us don't get on with her at all, as she's always humiliating people by talking down to us. For example my coworker has a lisp and last week when she asked him how far along he was with a project he said it would still take another while, she basically blew up at him but half of the time when she was screaming at him, she was putting on a fake lisp to mock him. She'll always leave a pile of work onto other people because she needs to leave work to collect her kids from school when the father doesn't show up to collect them when it's his turn. Another thing is she always expects us to stay on later than expected and coming in earlier, but we don't get paid for this time.//That's just a few examples because if I listed all of the things she's, it would go over the word limit.//So today I got told I'm being promoted to a much higher position within the company, I'm excited about it as it pays better and will give me a lot more responsibility. The thing is this position basically will make Leanne my subordinate. So I was telling a few coworkers about the promotion, we were just standing in the break room laughing and chatting and she came in.//She started giving out about us not working, saying things like 'oh I get it, you guys must think you're on vacation just because its a nice day out do you?', at one point she turned to my Mexican coworker and said 'you shouldn't add to the stereotypes' and eventually said 'if you people don't get your butts back to your office right now, I'm going to report it to higher management'//The more she talked the angrier I got and when she finally finished berating us I stood silently for a second and then just said something like 'I'll consider this being you reporting it to higher management, as that's currently my position in [company]'. One of my coworkers snorted and Leanne looked furious.//Then I just told her that me and my coworkers were okay to be in the break room, as it was literally our break time, that it was pretty rich to tell us we couldn't take a coffee break when she herself would leave work regularly to pick up her kids because her ex husband couldn't be bothered. I said that she wasn't to speak to any of us like that anymore or I'd have her written up within the minute.//She stood there for like a whole minute it felt like and started tearing up, then she left without a word. I felt horrible afterwards because i humiliated her in front of people shes managing and made her cry, my coworkers are saying she had it coming but one of them thinks I went too far bringing her kids into it.

"My company has a training website that we use. Think companyname.trainingwebsite.com. Employees are required to log in to this website with a username and password to complete this training. If you go directly to that site all you need is your username and password. If, however, you go to trainingwebsite.com you have to log in with an organization code.//As I get at least ten calls a week from people asking me for their login information (For some I just forward the same exact email I sent them last time with the same exact attachment) giving them the company code will just cause confusion and encourage more idiotic phone calls to me.//Last week an employee called me up insisting that she needed the code and that the website on her login sheet was requiring it. I instructed her to type the link into the address bar which she insisted she had done. I asked if she had typed the link into Google or if she had clicked on it, as typing the link into Google will bring up the main website. She insisted she clicked on it. I went to the website and logged in as her with no code and told her it was fine. Boomers tend to type web addresses into Google search, I have no idea why.//Well she went to her supervisor in tears that the website was broken and I refused to help her. The vice president of the company pulled me into a conference room, ripped into me, and ordered me to give everyone the code. I tried to explain she wasn't following simple instructions but he kept cutting me off saying that my instructions were wrong.//I saw red. I found the employee and ordered her to come with me, I brought her to the conference room, handed her login sheet to her, and instructed her to log in on the presentation monitor. She began pulling up Google. I ordered her to stop, reminding her that she had insisted she didn't type it in Google.//She said that's how you go to a website. I shook my head, ""No, it isn't! You swore you didn't go to Google so if you are not a liar, show me where the website required that code.""//Her supervisor told her to type it in the address bar, and when she did, surprise surprise, no code required. She insisted that it had required it before.//I said, ""No, it did not. You lied to me, you lied to your supervisor, and you wasted everyone's time today. Next time just admit you can't follow directions.""//The supervisor thinks I should have handled it one on one and I was TA for embarrassing her. The VP agrees with me and thinks that she needed to be ready to back up her complaint. The employee keeps insisting she's not a liar and I went out of my way to insult her.",YTA,YTA,YTA
"For a little backstory, I've worked at my agency for 5 years and worked my way up to manager. I was instrumental in hiring the employee, let's call her Pam. I wasn't her direct supervisor but I was the Director of Compliance for the full agency when we kinda got into a tiff. I sent Pam an email asking her to contact a specific client for a time sensitive matter. She did not respond to my email and when I checked with her later, she said she didn't contact the client because she didn't think it was necessary. I told her she needed to do what I asked her to do and if she has questions about anything to let me know instead of ignoring the directive.//After that, Pam didn't like me. About a year later, another Director position opend up that I applied for and got. I was now Pam's supervisor's boss. My new role was announced about 3 weeks before it was to be effective.//The week before my position started, Pam is out on a week's vacation (approved). On the first day of her vacation, Pam submits her resignation notice giving 13 day's notice. Since she was on vacation, it was impossible to work on transitioning her work for while she was out so we had to do some scrambling.//When she came back from vacation, she learned her health benefits end on her last day rather than at the end of the month. Well, Pam came to me asking if she could extend her last day one extra day and I denied it. She tried to make it seem like she didn't realize she gave 13 day's notice instead of 14. I said her presence was no longer necessary and I accepted her original resignation date.//The end result was she basically cussed me out, sent a mass all-staff email trashing me, left causing a scene, and ended up getting banned from the building. The next day a bunch of people were saying I went too far and it wasn't that serious. I don't think I did anything wrong. Am I the asshole?",YTA,YTA,YTA
